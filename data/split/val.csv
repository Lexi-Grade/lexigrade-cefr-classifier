"Modern graffiti began in big cities in the United States in the 1970s. In New York, young people wrote their names, or 'tags', in pen on walls around the city.

One of the first 'taggers' was a teenager called Demetrius. His tag was TAKI 183. He wrote his tag on walls and in stations in New York. Other teenagers saw Demetrius's tag and started writing their tags too. Soon, there were tags on walls, buses and trains all over New York.

Then, some teenagers started writing their tags with aerosol paint. Their tags were bigger and more colourful. Aerosol paint graffiti became very popular in the 1970s and 1980s. It appeared on trains, buses and walls around the world.

In the 1990s and 2000s, a lot of graffiti artists started painting pictures. Some artists' pictures were about politics. Other artists wanted to make cities beautiful and painted big, colourful pictures on city walls.
In some countries, writing or painting on walls is a crime. Sometimes, graffiti artists have problems with the police. In other countries, artists can draw and paint in certain places. For example, in Taiwan, there are 'graffiti zones' where artists can paint on walls. In São Paulo in Brazil, street artists can paint pictures on walls and houses. Their pictures are colourful and beautiful. Some tourists visit São Paulo just to see the street art!
In Bristol in the UK, there is a street art festival in August every year. Artists paint all the buildings in a street. Lots of people come to watch the artists and take photos.

Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science technology and industralization, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. But I do not think so. The mankind civilization could not reach its now-a-days standard without dreaming and imagination. Our dreaming and imagination are being fulfilled every day. So we can fly by planes, sail by liners and submarines, we discovered new lands, we are still finding new worlds in the universe. We have large cities where millions of people live together .
Let's make retrospective outlook on our lives. When we were children, we dreamt about fairies, witches, princes, princesses, dragons and all these creatures from the fairy-tale world. We were imagining how it would be wonderful to be like they were, to live in their world. But time flew and we got older. We started to perceive the real world where no creature from the fairy-tale lived. I started to understand my life as a neverending row of problems. To live means to solve these problems less or more sucessfully .
And when hard moments of our lives come, we dream about easy childhood how careless it was. We try to imagine the world without problems. But it is not like this, so we must keep on trying to create it according to our dreams .
After finishing the school studies we meet problem how to find a good and well paid job. Everybody wants to feel that his work is needful and makes sense. Everybody, I hope, does not like to work just for himself, man wants to earn money to feed his wife and children. This is our dream to have a nice and happy family. We all remember the time when we first fell in love. When the first love came away and we felt so dissapointed the dream that we maybe would find new love and new meaning of life kept us "" alive "".
I also dreamt about man who would be my partner for the rest of my life and who would be father of my children. As a child I wanted a prince, of course. Then I met several men, but my heart was beating as usually. Now I am married it means I found him. I can say I am happy. He is the same like in my dreams. He is clever, gentle, tall man with blue eyes and salt and pepper hair [ even if he is twenty five ]. We started to build our own world. He works in insurance and I hope that I start my teaching in this autumn, finally. We are on the very beginning of our lives we are talking about it every day, but not only about the way we want to live. We are also talking about those little important things such as f. e. the colour of furniture and carpet in our future bedroom, because now we live in a lodging .

"Title: Do you think that the death penalty should be abolished? 
 
In the middle of the 18th century there was no doubt about the expediency of the death penalty. The Carolina (1536) provided a death penalty in most cases of crime. The execution was extremly cruel. During the 18th century the death penalty had slowly been pushed aside by imprisonment. The fight against the death penalty has started in the Enlightment and has not ended yet. The Pro and Contra deals mainly wit two questions: 1.	The ethic question wheter the government has the right to demand the life of an individual for the sake of the community .
2.	The question wheter or not the death penalty is necessary and suits for the protection of the society .
In the German Reich the death penalty was taken into the Penal Statute again but with the restriction to murder. The execution was set through decapitation with no allowance to the public. The military Penal Statute executed through shooting .
Nowadays the death penalty is abolished in most european coutries and in some states in Northamerica. So far about the history .
I am of the opinion that the death penalty is abolished because nobody has the right to decide about the life of another person. Of course a murderer has not the right either. Anyway I think that our overcrowded prisons are a result of the fact that children have had their childhood stolen from them. Sometimes their childhood had been stolen through their parents because they abused their children. But a child need not be abused. It is enough if does not feel the love of a mother or a father. If we take a look at the case of James Bulgar whose tormentors are both just 13 years old. And it is known by now, that they did never have a harmonic familylife .
But there are also people imprisoned and wait for their execution who are innocent. They never had a fair lawsuit and a real chance to get out of it. These people do often not have enough money to have their own attorney. In most cases these people who are treated unfairly are black people. Most famous example is the case of Gary Graham. It has been proven, that he had been treated unfairly, but the American Justice does not want to get into the case once again .
In addition, I think the inequality between black and white will stay forever in the minds of most of the Americans. As well as we have it in Europe with Turks, for instance .
As I mentioned before I think, that no-one has the right to decide if someone may live or not. But I must confess that I do not think the same way if somebody abuses and kills innocent children. These people should be executed as fast as possible. I believe that the children are our future and without them mankind would become extinct. What we need to learn is not childish. Being with them connects us to the deep wisdom of life, which is everpresent and only asks to believed. So, if anyone kills that source where all the love and divine comes from, he is not worth living .
Another sad and cruel thing is the way how the convict is treated. Some people received their date of execution, were lead to the execution room and were finally taken back to their cell again. But this does not happen just once. It is likely that things like that happen more than five times. It is like psychological war with the convicts .
If a state eagerly wants to kill people in a legal way, the government should create a law to do that in an instant and not after 25 years. It is not relevant that I guess .",B1,"{'title': '166_GESA4011.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Do you think that the death penalty should be abolished? \n \nIn the middle of the 18th century there was no doubt about the expediency of the death penalty.

"Title: In the words of the old song ""Money is the root of all evil"". Agree or disagree? 

The saying that [Quotation] has probably never been more true than it is in our time. Money is a crucial aspect of everyone's lives and it can be said that it controles our lives. After all, we need money to provide the basic things we need in order to survive: food, water, shelter, as well as all the other things we need in everyday life. Money is also probably the main reason people have jobs; in order to have money we have to earn it by doing something which can be valued. Being such an important part of our lives, it is no wonder people think that ""Money is the root of all evil"" and I tend to agree with these words and will explain in this essay why .
One of the first things which come to mind when thinking about how money is the root of our problems is the different ways people get it. Having the importance that it has in our lives, it is easy to understand why some people would do almost anything to gain certain amounts of it. Not everyone is ready to work the same way as most people do, to have a job which benefits the community in some way, but choose to do things which are in our society considered as illegal or unethical. Those things can range from petty crimes to serious offences which can harm someone's life, but what they all have in common is that they harm our community and the rules we chose to live by, all because of money .
Another claim for money being the cause of all bad things in this world is our dependence on it. Money is so integrated in our way of living that today nobody can function without it. People need money in order to have drinking water and food, healthcare and homes, not to mention all the other things needed for a person to be a part of the society. To have a normal life, one needs money, which is why we are all as a society obsessed with having it .
One another reason for seeing ""money as root of all evil"" is the status and importance we have become accustomed in ascribing to it. Money today has a god-like importance to people. Their value is often measured with the amount of money they have or do not have. Many people see it as a solution to all of lives problems and the lack of it as the end of the world. Money is often the reason of numerous family fall-outs, ended friendships and relationships. This status and importance we give to money leads many people to value it more than the things which in truth are much more important than bank notes .
All in all, there are many reasons why money can be seen as the root of all bad things in the world, including the ways some people get it, our dependence on it and the status and importance we give it.

"Listen, and I will tell you of the famous dark day in Connecticut. It
was in the month of May, more than a hundred years ago.

The sun rose bright and fair, and the morning was without a cloud. The
air was very still. There was not a breath of wind to stir the young
leaves on the trees.

Then, about the middle of the day, it began to grow dark. The sun was
hidden. A black cloud seemed to cover the earth.

The birds flew to their nests. The chickens went to roost. The cows
came home from the pasture and stood mooing at the gate. It grew so
dark that the people could not see their way along the streets.

Then everybody began to feel frightened. ""What is the matter? What is
going to happen?"" each one asked of another. The children cried. The
dogs howled. The women wept, and some of the men prayed.

""The end of the world has come!"" cried some; and they ran about in the
darkness.

""This is the last great day!"" cried others; and they knelt down and
waited.

In the old statehouse, the wise men of Connecticut were sitting. They
were men who made the laws, and much depended upon their wisdom.

When the darkness came, they too began to be alarmed. The gloom was
terrible.

""It is the day of the Lord."" said one.

""No use to make laws,"" said another, ""for they will never be needed.""

""I move that we adjourn,"" said a third.

"It's true - we're all getting too big for our boots
Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris, though still only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man.
Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. Intriguingly, this does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Only now are we losing the effects of generations of poor diet - with dramatic effects. 'We are only now beginning to fulfil our proper potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.'
For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from a wide variety of sources: women gathered herbs, fruits and berries, while men supplemented these with occasional kills of animals (a way of life still adopted by the world's few remaining tribes of hunter- gatherers). One research study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants, for example. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented - with devastating consequences. Most of the planet's green places have been gradually taken over by farmers, with the result that just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by the human race today.
This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists discovered that when they began to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers were turned into sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being one of the blessings of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists.
Nevertheless, from then on agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had previously lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets.
As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not moved on, it seems. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products.
The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.
However, scientists add one note of qualification. Individuals may be growing taller because of improved nutrition, but as a species we are actually shrinking.

In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.",B2,"{'title': '28.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""It's true - we're all getting too big for our boots\nChris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris, though still only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man.\nEvery decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. Intriguingly, this does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Only now are we losing the effects of generations of poor diet - with dramatic effects. 'We are only now beginning to fulfil our proper potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.'\nFor most of human history, our ancestors got their food from a wide variety of sources: women gathered herbs, fruits and berries, while men supplemented these with occasional kills of animals (a way of life still adopted by the world's few remaining tribes of hunter- gatherers). One research study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants, for example. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented - with devastating consequences. Most of the planet's green places have been gradually taken over by farmers, with the result that just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by the human race today.\nThis poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists discovered that when they began to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers were turned into sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being one of the blessings of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists.\nNevertheless, from then on agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had previously lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets.\nAs a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not moved on, it seems. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products.\nThe question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.\nHowever, scientists add one note of qualification. Individuals may be growing taller because of improved nutrition, but as a species we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, members of the human race were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have got slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further. In other words, the growth of human beings could be offset by global warming.\n""}"

Thank you for your letter. I had my first day at my new school today. A girl called Nicole looked after me and showed me where the classrooms were. She is very nice and I am going to visit her this weekend.
My favourite lesson today was Maths and I was happy because I knew more than the other girls. I also played hockey for the first time. I really enjoyed it. 
Most of the teachers seem friendly but I'm afraid of the head teacher. No one likes him because he shouts a lot.

"Title: English is an easy language to learn 
 
Why are some students successful at language learning while others are not?
Why is the foreign language sometimes easy for one group of people and difficult for the other at the same time?
People involved in language teaching often say that students who really want to learn will succeed whatever the circumstances in which they study. The biggest factor affecting their success is the motivation that students bring to class. Motivation is some kind of ""internal drive"" that encourages somebody to pursue a course of action .
If we perceive a goal and that goal is sufficiently attractive, we will be strongly motivated to do whatever is necessary to reach it. Language learners who are motivated perceive goals of various kinds; short-term goals and long-term goals .
In general, strongly motivated students with long-term goals probably learn easier than those who have no such goals .
Apart from the motivation, physical conditions have great effect on learning the foreign language (not necessarily English). When people get older their speech organs are stiffer. It would be much easier for children to develop pronunciation skill than for adults. In general, English is easily and willingly learned by children. It is very good for children to start learning English at the age of six or seven .
The English grammar rules are not very complicated, especially at the beginner's stage, so they are very easily learned by the students .
Success in learning English as a foreign language depends on the learner's nationality. It is very important what the learner's native language is. For Chinese, for example, English would be more difficult than for any other European because these two cultures, Chinese and English, are very distant. Germen, on the contrary, would be better learners at English because these two languages are not very distant (some words are even similar).
Although Polish grammar is different from English one, Polish students don't have bigger problems with understanding and acquiring the English rules .
English has a special position since it has become the international language of communication. It has become very fashionable as well. You can meet English everywhere: TV, radio, computers and even in the street .
Nowadays, especially in Poland, everything what comes from America is the best. When you go to the cinema you can see mostly an American film and hear real American accent, on the radio most songs are in English but not necessarily singing by an Englishman or an American. A lot of songs are written in English because they sound better and more people could understand them. English is present also in computers so if you want to operate the computer you have to know the language .
As I said English is present everywhere now because it has become extremely popular these days. Everybody wants to learn it and know it as it's the most fashionable language in the world. It sounds nice and it's easy to learn.

"Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
Although this is a general discussion about the prison system but I am talking about the prison system in Pakistan. The prison system in Pakistan is really out dated. It is centuries old that was designed by the British against the Indians and the Muslims. Almost all the systems in Pakistan are those which were made by the British to humiliate and dominate the people of sub continent. In Pakistan this system of prison is centuries old and too bad. Rather it has reached to the level of worst. As police is associated with the prison system and the law and order system, so the corruption is at its highest level in these departments. So the prison system is also not free of this curse. The bribery is very much common is there in the prisons. The officials in prisons openly take bribe for various purposes. Even inside the prisons the drugs and arms can be found easily. There are officials involved in all these games. The prisoners are dealt with very bad methods. They are brutally tortured and there are different methods to be used to torture them. Mostly the criminals become more criminals when they leave jails and prisons. All this is because the prisoners are not treated as human beings. Rather they are taken as animals and non humans. The brutal torture and the company of further criminals make them rather big criminals. Even the facilities for prisoners are not good in prisons. The food the prisoners are given is usually substandard. The other facilities are also too poor and not up to the mark. The proper way to treat criminals is not to punish them severely. There may be other ways to treat the criminals. They should be rehabilitated. The system does not say to hate the criminals. But it says to hate the crimes. So the criminals should not be hated. Rather they should be given more care and attention so that they are not doing the crimes next time. This approach would give very much positive results and the crime rate may be reduced.

Similarly, there should be some psychologists in the prisons where the psychotherapy of the criminals should be done so that next time they don't commit the same crimes. The counseling may be the best option for them. There should be some system to educate the prisoners and criminals. The religious education should also be given along with the other education.

"Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

	It is true that in our modern world, concidering the development that has been noticed in the scientific and technological fields, it is a little difficult to find a place for dreaming and imagination; dreaming-that is in that pure escense of a child's soul .
	Lots of people believe that the industrialization of our life has made it impossible for us to make dreams. They tend to see development in a negative perspective, allowing technology to play a very small part in their every-day life - still, this isn't true for all of these people; some of them may use a lot of science's discoveries and take advantage of the technological progress but, at the same time they keep complaining for the loss of innocence. They keep accusing development for the loss of dreaming and imagination; as if people don't have the time to dream any more or someone has deprived them of their freedom to imagine a better life!
	In my opinion, the truth lies somewhere in the middle; people may have lost some of their old ideology but there is always a place and a little time for us to dream. Probably this is because a life without dreaming couldn't go on; people need to make dreams in order to escape every-day life's difficulties and problems. This is the only solution, the only way to deal with our life's routine and get through, without falling into deep depression. After all, there would not be any technological or scientific development if people didn't make dreams .
	It is rather obvious that all of our modern society's achievements are a result of people's imagination! If human beings didn't have dreams for a-constantly becoming-better future, then we would still live in a primitive society and we would have conciliated with the idea of a life full of difficulties, a life full of personal struggle for survival!
	People are-even in our modern world - able to dream and imagine how their life could be better, not only in a personal aspect but also, concerning other human beings. We all need to make dreams for our world to continue developing. The world is not dominated by science, technology or industrialization; these are all human's achievements taking advantage of which society can continue progressing. The world is dominated by us, people and by correctly using this authority that has been given to us, we can make miracles in every scientific field!

What is your opinion? \n\n\tIt is true that in our modern world, concidering the development that has been noticed in the scientific and technological fields, it is a little difficult to find a place for dreaming and imagination; dreaming-that is in that pure escense of a child's soul .\n\tLots of people believe that the industrialization of our life has made it impossible for us to make dreams. They tend to see development in a negative perspective, allowing technology to play a very small part in their every-day life - still, this isn't true for all of these people; some of them may use a lot of science's discoveries and take advantage of the technological progress but, at the same time they keep complaining for the loss of innocence. They keep accusing development for the loss of dreaming and imagination; as if people don't have the time to dream any more or someone has deprived them of their freedom to imagine a better life!\n\tIn my opinion, the truth lies somewhere in the middle; people may have lost some of their old ideology but there is always a place and a little time for us to dream. Probably this is because a life without dreaming couldn't go on; people need to make dreams in order to escape every-day life's difficulties and problems. This is the only solution, the only way to deal with our life's routine and get through, without falling into deep depression. After all, there would not be any technological or scientific development if people didn't make dreams .\n\tIt is rather obvious that all of our modern society's achievements are a result of people's imagination! If human beings didn't have dreams for a-constantly becoming-better future, then we would still live in a primitive society and we would have conciliated with the idea of a life full of difficulties, a life full of personal struggle for survival!\n\tPeople are-even in our modern world - able to dream and imagine how their life could be better, not only in a personal aspect but also, concerning other human beings. We all need to make dreams for our world to continue developing. The world is not dominated by science, technology or industrialization; these are all human's achievements taking advantage of which society can continue progressing. The world is dominated by us, people and by correctly using this authority that has been given to us, we can make miracles in every scientific field! The responsibility lies in our hands; it's our dreams that become realized; our imagination in practice that brings all these technological revolutions. As long as people with spontaneity and good will are alive, there is always a place for dreaming and imagination. It's the same place where we can find all of our modern world's accomplishments .\n""}"

"No Title 

On the very last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting to catch the 10.10 to Philadelphia. There were a lot more people waiting than I had expected. That airy, light, clean, polished feeling I generally got in the station had been lost. Elderly couples with matching luggage stuffed the benches, and swarms of college kids littered the floor with their bags.
A grey-haired man was walking around speaking to different strangers one by one. Well-off, you could tell: tanned skin, nice sweater, soft, beige car-coat. He went up to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl standing near me. She had long blond hair, and I had been thinking I wouldn't mind talking to her myself. The man said, 'Would you by any chance be travelling to Philadelphia?'
'Well, northbound, yes,' she said. 'But to Philadelphia?'
'No, New York, but I'll be ...'
'Thanks, anyway,' he said, and he moved toward the next bench.
Now he had my full attention. 'Ma'am,' I heard him ask an old lady, 'are you travelling to
Philadelphia?' When the woman told him, 'Wilmington,' he didn't say a thing, just marched on down the row to one of the matched-luggage couples. I straightened up from my pillar and drifted closer, looking toward the platform as if I had my mind on the train.
Well, I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn't, of course.
No doubt, I struck him as unreliable. He just glanced quickly at me and then swerved off toward the bench at the other end of the waiting area. By now he was looking seriously stressed. 'Please!' he said to a woman reading a book. 'Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!'
She lowered her book. She was thirtyish, maybe thirty-five - older than I was, anyhow. A school- teacher sort. 'Philadelphia?' she said. 'Why, yes, I am.'
'Then could I ask you a favour?'
I stopped several feet away and frowned down at my left wrist. (Never mind that I don't own a watch.) Even without looking, I could sense how she went on guard. The man must have sensed it too, because he said, 'Nothing too difficult, I promise!'
They were announcing my train now. People started moving toward Gate E, the older couples hauling their wheeled bags behind them like big pets on leashes. Next I heard the man talking. 'My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. So I put her on a train this morning, stopping for groceries afterward, and came home to find my wife in a state. She hardly said ""hello"" to me. You see my daughter'd forgotten her passport. She'd telephoned home from the station in Philadelphia; didn't know what to do next.'
The woman clucked sympathetically. I'd have kept quiet myself. Waited to find out where he was heading with this.
'So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, I said, and I would get somebody here to carry up her passport.'
A likely story! Why didn't he go himself, if this was such an emergency?
'Why don't you go yourself?' the woman asked him.
'I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair.'
This seemed like a pretty poor excuse, if you want my honest opinion. Also, it exceeded the amount of bad luck that one family could expect. I let my eyes wander toward the two of them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, which would have been the logical choice, but one of those padded envelopes the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn't feel the contents! And from where I stood, it looked to be stapled shut besides. Watch yourself, lady, I said silently.",B2,"{'title': 'c3ff96fb-35d1-4ef9-a479-e72a247c0f81.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'No Title \n\nOn the very last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore railway station, waiting to catch the 10.10 to Philadelphia.

"Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

As the world's developing grows incredibly fast, we are not even aware of all of the changes that is bringing to us. Science achievements, technology inventions and huge industrialization, each of them affects on each of us. It is clear - there are consequences, but they are expectable and reasonable consequences and results are both good and bad and their influences are more or less equal. However, we should finally distinct them and provide all of the good and bad sides of this modern age. Are we completely overtaken by modern achievements? Are we robots, machines, emotionless and programmed or they still haven't got such a hold on us? If they have, how to deal with it and what to do?
Has the science reached its own top? Look around. Science is everything and everywhere. Technology is everything and everywhere. Industrialization too. We are surrounded by mobile phones, computers, all of the kinds of machines. Those machines are working and living with us and for us. I can not imagine spending only one day without my phone. On the first place, because of communication, on the second place, because of the information - some things for school and education and for my personal interests. And that's brilliant! Being able to talk with a friend who's miles away. Being able to see a friend, to share photos etc. Furthermore, whenever we need to know something, which we knew but forgot or we simple want to know, we can just ask ""Google"". ""Google"" knows. We are completely informed, completely protected and we have completely solved our lack of knowledge. Or we at least think we have.
The internet opens a whole new life and a whole new world to us. There is no single thing that we can not find on the internet. Internet's options and knowledges are endless. In this connotation, we can not see bad sides of technology. Various kind of social media, ""Facebook"", ""Youtube"", ""Instagram"", people, (mainly young people) find very useful, productive and interesting. Some of them are quite inspirational, which gives the ideas for people to think more, to create more, to search more, to develop more. We have a numerous examples everywhere, of people who started working on internet. At the beggining, it started as a hoby, now, they have already earned a bunch of money.
Every day we are exposed to the influences of social media. We are living our lives there. Fortunatelly, not all of us but there's already a quite big number of those who are affected.

Following celebrity profiles, seeing the kind of life that they're living, seeing the way they look alike and as the result - wanting to be them, wanting to be like them.

"Build it yourself at the UK's first bamboo bike workshop 

A course at the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, buys you a computer-designed custom frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. 

It's Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and apart from a mechanic deep in the bowels of a truck, the only sign of life among the small factories on a backstreet is a whine of machinery from an upper window - work has begun at Bamboo Bike Club, Britain's only bamboo bike-building course. I've gone along to watch the action. 
There's a sense of energy and industry. And of fun. Woodwork class was never like this. Bamboo is one of the most interesting trends to emerge in bike construction. Names like Californian manufacturer Calfee Design or Yorkshire's Bamboo Bikes have revived a construction method pioneered as early as 1894. The problem for most cyclists is the price. A ready-made bamboo frame from these companies retails for $2,995, or PS1,868. 
It was this, plus the design challenge, that led James and Ian to spend years cooped up in a shed in Brecon, Wales. Their idea was to establish a boutique bamboo bike business with products within reach of the average cyclist. 
Only after they had refined their research into a marketable product - James now tosses out phrases like 'close-noded thick-wall tubes' while talking about bamboo - did they realise they were on the wrong track. 'We realised we didn't want just to sell frames. We wanted to share the joy of making something; the craft of creating something unique and sustainable,' James explains. 
The outcome was something more community than company, and as such, the Bamboo Bike Club is still an occupation sandwiched between full-time jobs - James makes wind turbines and Ian is a civil engineer. But they seem to be on the right track, with monthly courses whose competitive price buys you a computer-designed custom bike frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. 
The question for me, a king of the botch job - my terrible handiwork failures litter my house - was about quality. On day one, the boys explain how to select bamboo for strength and how to form strong joints before tubes are glued lightly in place in the workshop: first the front triangle composed of 40 mm diameter bamboo; then the thinner, more fiddly seat and the chain assembly. Alloy tubes are inserted for the handlebars, wheel forks and other parts which require the strength and precise engineering impossible in bamboo. 
All this, together with the technical skill involved in using jigs, power tools and design blueprints, is a leap of faith for someone whose idea of DIY is flatpack furniture assembly. Accurate cutting for a clean joint can be tricky, for example. 
James and Ian buzz cheerfully between workbenches, supervising every cut, triple-checking every joint, and will take over if a task seems insurmountable. The self-build is half the attraction for most participants; it may be no coincidence that all those on this course were engineers. For the rest of us, Ian reassures that everyone messes up once or twice. 
No problem - just get another piece and have another go. Such is the benefit of bamboo. Each length has been pre-checked for quality, so you get to indulge in frame aesthetics: plain bamboo, black or mottled. 
Sunday is a more relaxed day, mainly spent building the lugs. Or rather, wraps: hemp bindings wrapped around the joints and dropouts then glued with epoxy resin to form a strong bond that disperses loads evenly throughout the frame. With a final polymer coating for waterproofing, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, saddle and any other individual touches. And it is a bike built for the long haul, just as strong, the pair claim, as its metal equivalents. 
Ian has ridden his for over a year on a 16-mile commute, while James has failed to destroy one bike off-road over three months of testing. 'To be honest, our bikes are over-engineered - we use larger diameter tubes and over-thick bindings - but I prefer it like that,' James says. 
Technical issues aside, how good does a bamboo bike look? Somewhat scruffy alongside professional frames, it turns out - the hemp weave can look a bit like parcel tape, for example. But there's no denying their individuality and that, say James and Ian, is the point. 
Personally though, I believe that any bicycle made from this kind of material should be a relaxed affair, something for cruising sedately around on rather than racing. I therefore plump for a frame that avoids the stiff angularity of my existing metal machine: a 'Classic English' giving a gentle, easy-going ride. 
They also cycle well. I take James's bike for a spin and the ride is light, stiff and smooth thanks to bamboo's ability to dampen vibration. Impressive, considering I target every pothole. 'Some people love the build, but for me these workshops come together when the bike is on the road,' James says. 'They're so light, so effortless to ride.

I've gone along to watch the action. \nThere's a sense of energy and industry. And of fun. Woodwork class was never like this. Bamboo is one of the most interesting trends to emerge in bike construction. Names like Californian manufacturer Calfee Design or Yorkshire's Bamboo Bikes have revived a construction method pioneered as early as 1894. The problem for most cyclists is the price. A ready-made bamboo frame from these companies retails for $2,995, or PS1,868. \nIt was this, plus the design challenge, that led James and Ian to spend years cooped up in a shed in Brecon, Wales. Their idea was to establish a boutique bamboo bike business with products within reach of the average cyclist. \nOnly after they had refined their research into a marketable product - James now tosses out phrases like 'close-noded thick-wall tubes' while talking about bamboo - did they realise they were on the wrong track. 'We realised we didn't want just to sell frames. We wanted to share the joy of making something; the craft of creating something unique and sustainable,' James explains. \nThe outcome was something more community than company, and as such, the Bamboo Bike Club is still an occupation sandwiched between full-time jobs - James makes wind turbines and Ian is a civil engineer. But they seem to be on the right track, with monthly courses whose competitive price buys you a computer-designed custom bike frame plus a fun weekend of bike-building. \nThe question for me, a king of the botch job - my terrible handiwork failures litter my house - was about quality. On day one, the boys explain how to select bamboo for strength and how to form strong joints before tubes are glued lightly in place in the workshop: first the front triangle composed of 40 mm diameter bamboo; then the thinner, more fiddly seat and the chain assembly. Alloy tubes are inserted for the handlebars, wheel forks and other parts which require the strength and precise engineering impossible in bamboo. \nAll this, together with the technical skill involved in using jigs, power tools and design blueprints, is a leap of faith for someone whose idea of DIY is flatpack furniture assembly. Accurate cutting for a clean joint can be tricky, for example. \nJames and Ian buzz cheerfully between workbenches, supervising every cut, triple-checking every joint, and will take over if a task seems insurmountable. The self-build is half the attraction for most participants; it may be no coincidence that all those on this course were engineers. For the rest of us, Ian reassures that everyone messes up once or twice. \nNo problem - just get another piece and have another go. Such is the benefit of bamboo. Each length has been pre-checked for quality, so you get to indulge in frame aesthetics: plain bamboo, black or mottled. \nSunday is a more relaxed day, mainly spent building the lugs. Or rather, wraps: hemp bindings wrapped around the joints and dropouts then glued with epoxy resin to form a strong bond that disperses loads evenly throughout the frame. With a final polymer coating for waterproofing, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, saddle and any other individual touches. And it is a bike built for the long haul, just as strong, the pair claim, as its metal equivalents. \nIan has ridden his for over a year on a 16-mile commute, while James has failed to destroy one bike off-road over three months of testing. 'To be honest, our bikes are over-engineered - we use larger diameter tubes and over-thick bindings - but I prefer it like that,' James says. \nTechnical issues aside, how good does a bamboo bike look? Somewhat scruffy alongside professional frames, it turns out - the hemp weave can look a bit like parcel tape, for example. But there's no denying their individuality and that, say James and Ian, is the point. \nPersonally though, I believe that any bicycle made from this kind of material should be a relaxed affair, something for cruising sedately around on rather than racing. I therefore plump for a frame that avoids the stiff angularity of my existing metal machine: a 'Classic English' giving a gentle, easy-going ride. \nThey also cycle well. I take James's bike for a spin and the ride is light, stiff and smooth thanks to bamboo's ability to dampen vibration. Impressive, considering I target every pothole. 'Some people love the build, but for me these workshops come together when the bike is on the road,' James says. 'They're so light, so effortless to ride. So much fun to ride too - take a Harley-style retro bike, add 10 and you're still not close.' And the price? Less than PS500. ""}"

"Air-conditioning

There is a chill in the air at Cannons Gym, a favourite lunch-time haunt for City of London workers. To deal with this summer's unusually high temperatures, the fitness centre has gone overboard with the air-conditioning. So much so, in fact, that at quiet times, the gym feels like somewhere in the Arctic. This is just one example of how the modern world casually misuses air-conditioning. It has become a central feature of work and play, a potent symbol of the ability of humanity to control the climate, or at least modify it.
Many air-conditioned buildings, however, could employ other methods of cooling. They could take advantage of daylight and natural ventilation and have thicker walls that absorb less heat during the day and radiate it away at night. These measures may sound obvious, but they can have telling results and would considerably reduce the need for air-conditioning.

Sundials

It is surely more than coincidence that the beginning of a new millennium is being accompanied by renewed interest in sundials: instruments used to measure time according to the position of the sun. A hundred years ago, they were a vital time-keeping device, essential for anyone who hoped to keep their clocks working accurately. Then, as clocks and watches became more sophisticated and reliable, the sundial was relegated to the status of garden ornament - a romantic and intriguing ornament, but nonetheless an anachronism, in a brave new technological age. Now the clock has been turned back and they are again being taken seriously.
David Harber, a sundial maker, believes that their appeal lies in their direct link with the planets. He says that when he delivers one, there is a moment of magic when it starts working. They are still, calm, romantic objects that remind us of our place in the cosmos.

Their hands never wobbled, the paint never smudged, and the observer might have concluded that these women had either been practising their art for decades or had been born with an extraordinary talent for steady precision.

"An eye for detail

Artist Susan Shepherd is best known for her flower paintings, and the large garden that surrounds her house is the source of many of her subjects. It is full of her favourite flowers, most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the two long flower borders that line the paved path which crosses the garden from east to west. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners, and who left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. 'In fact, it was really his garden,' she says. 'We got on very well. At first he would say, ""Oh, it's not worth it"" to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he recognised what I had in mind.'
Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants where they are. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. 'I don't set the whole thing up at once,' she says. 'I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.'
Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out, followed by the poppies. 'They all come out together, and you're so busy,' she says. But the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, 'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.'
Susan has always been interested in plants: 'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside,' she says. 'I wasn't particularly interested in gardening then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers, I thought they looked like the ones made of silk or plastic that were sold in some florists' shops - to me, the only real ones were wild. I was intrigued by the way they managed to flower in really awkward places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.' Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas.

It is full of her favourite flowers, most especially varieties of tulips and poppies. Some of the plants are unruly and seed themselves all over the garden. There is a harmony of colour, shape and structure in the two long flower borders that line the paved path which crosses the garden from east to west. Much of this is due to the previous owners who were keen gardeners, and who left plants that appealed to Susan. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. \'In fact, it was really his garden,\' she says. \'We got on very well. At first he would say, ""Oh, it\'s not worth it"" to some of the things I wanted to put in, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he recognised what I had in mind.\'\nSusan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than on the garden as a whole, though she will occasionally paint a group of plants where they are. More usually, she picks them and then takes them up to her studio. \'I don\'t set the whole thing up at once,\' she says. \'I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.\'\nHer busiest time of year is spring and early summer, when the tulips are out, followed by the poppies. \'They all come out together, and you\'re so busy,\' she says. But the gradual decaying process is also part of the fascination for her. With tulips, for example, \'you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day and they each form themselves into different shapes. They open out and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time with twists and turns.\'\nSusan has always been interested in plants: \'I did botany at school and used to collect wild flowers from all around the countryside,\' she says. \'I wasn\'t particularly interested in gardening then; in fact, I didn\'t like garden flowers, I thought they looked like the ones made of silk or plastic that were sold in some florists\' shops - to me, the only real ones were wild. I was intrigued by the way they managed to flower in really awkward places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.\' Nowadays, the garden owes much to plants that originated in far-off lands, though they seem as much at home in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas.

"An awfully big adventure

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it, and lived to tell the tale.

There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children’s stories used to specialise in them — courageous explorers with sunburnt, leathery skin and eyes narrowed by straining to see into far horizons on their journeys into the unknown. These days you no longer find such people in fiction, let alone in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore’s great adventure consisted of leading an expedition across one of the last unexplored places on earth, the Taklamakan Desert in western China. Its name means ‘once entered you never come out’, but local people call it the Desert of Death. He recalled the dangers and exhilaration of that amazing trek, in the calm atmosphere of his family home.
The team he led was composed of four Britons (one of them the party’s medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese (all experts on the area), 30 camels and six camel handlers. It later turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before, but were long-distance lorry drivers: a misunderstanding that could have cost everyone their lives and certainly jeopardised the expedition’s success. This mixed bunch set out to cross 1,200 kilometres of the world’s least hospitable desert and Charles Blackmore has written a mesmerising account of their journey. 
At the time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He launched the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, to prove something. ‘I had always assumed I’d spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered promotion but suddenly I felt I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was, outside all that. It was a tremendous gamble. Tina, my wife, was very worried that I wouldn’t come back as nobody had ever done that route; we went into it blind. In the event, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very kind to us.’
Anyone reading his extraordinary account of that crossing will wonder at the use of the word ‘kind’. The team suffered unspeakable hardships: dysentery; extremes of temperature; severe thirst and dehydration; the loss of part of their precious water supply. ‘But’, Blackmore explains, ‘when we were at the limits of our own endurance and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn’t experience the Taklamakan’s legendary sandstorms. And we never hit the raw, biting desert cold that would have totally immobilised us. That’s not to say that we weren’t fighting against hurdles the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were torture to climb, for us and for the heavily laden camels, which often rolled over onto us.
‘What drove me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no contingency plan. Neither our budget no time allowed one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills we were completely on our own.
‘I knew I had the mental stamina for the trip but I was very scared of my physical ability to do it. I remember day one — we sat at the edge of the desert and it was such an inferno that you couldn’t breathe. I thought, “We’ve got to do it now!” At that moment I was a very scared man.’
If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? ‘When you’ve walked for 1,000 kilometres you’re not going to duck out. You’ve endured so much; you’ve got so much behind you. We were very thin, but very muscular and sinewy despite our physical exhaustion. My body was well-toned and my legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.’
Midway through the book, Blackmore went on to describe lying in the desert gazing up at a full moon, thinking of his family. How conscious was he of the ordeal it must have been for them? ‘Inside me there’s someone trying to find peace with himself. When I have doubts about myself now, I go back to the image of the desert and think, well, we managed to pull that together. As a personal achievements, I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I’ve dine. Yet in terms of a lifetime’s achievement, I think of my family and the happiness we share — against that yardstick, the desert does not measure up, does not compare.’
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ‘I yearn for the challenge — for the open spaces — the resolve of it all. We were buoyed up by the sense of purpose. I find it difficult now to be part of the uniformity of modern life.’",C1,"{'title': 'e7f2557d-b2b5-4d26-bee5-f18b9d8b4044.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'An awfully big adventure\n\nThe Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on earth.

"Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Our society is said to be severely influenced by technology. Nowadays this influence is becoming so big that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. This is mainly due to the fact that new technologies, such as virtual reality and interactive television, are being developped irresponsibly. With all this new technology, man does no longer have to think for himself, everything is done for him. You could say that these developments are all very good for mankind, but the problem is that man does no longer think, period .
In the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, people had to work so hard, just to keep themselves and their families alive, that there was no time left for dreaming or imagination. But then came technology, because of machines the work became much lighter, people could go on holiday once in a while and had plenty of time to fantasize and dream. In this respect technology has been a blessing for mankind. However this ' blessing ' has now taken on such proportions that for some people it becomes almost impossible to think and dream freely. Technology can be used to stimulate people, to make them form their own opinions, but all too often it is used to impose the opinions and convictions of the people who are in control, on people who are using the technology. From this viewpoint our world is beginning to resemble the worl that Orwell described in ""1984"", a society that is controlled by a few people who have all the means to manipulate other people in such a way that creativity and fantasy become impossible. If however our technology and media are used in a responsible, ""well thoughout"" manner, they will stimulate people to think, give them time to do something else than make money, so that free imagination and dreaming become possible .
There is a second danger connected with this technology. Nowadays it is becoming so strong that you can create your own personal reality with it (the so-called ' virtual reality ' technology). This means that people can create their private universe, in which they control everything, with a computer. This ' virtual reality ' gives so much power to fantasy and imagination that it can become very confusing.

What is your opinion? \n \nOur society is said to be severely influenced by technology. Nowadays this influence is becoming so big that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. This is mainly due to the fact that new technologies, such as virtual reality and interactive television, are being developped irresponsibly. With all this new technology, man does no longer have to think for himself, everything is done for him. You could say that these developments are all very good for mankind, but the problem is that man does no longer think, period .\nIn the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, people had to work so hard, just to keep themselves and their families alive, that there was no time left for dreaming or imagination. But then came technology, because of machines the work became much lighter, people could go on holiday once in a while and had plenty of time to fantasize and dream. In this respect technology has been a blessing for mankind. However this \' blessing \' has now taken on such proportions that for some people it becomes almost impossible to think and dream freely. Technology can be used to stimulate people, to make them form their own opinions, but all too often it is used to impose the opinions and convictions of the people who are in control, on people who are using the technology. From this viewpoint our world is beginning to resemble the worl that Orwell described in ""1984"", a society that is controlled by a few people who have all the means to manipulate other people in such a way that creativity and fantasy become impossible. If however our technology and media are used in a responsible, ""well thoughout"" manner, they will stimulate people to think, give them time to do something else than make money, so that free imagination and dreaming become possible .\nThere is a second danger connected with this technology. Nowadays it is becoming so strong that you can create your own personal reality with it (the so-called \' virtual reality \' technology). This means that people can create their private universe, in which they control everything, with a computer. This \' virtual reality \' gives so much power to fantasy and imagination that it can become very confusing. The user of this technology could take this fictive world for the real world and suffer a severe shock when he\'s brought back into the reality, and even worse, he could decide to live the most important part of his life in this \' fictive \' reality and live the life of a vegetable in our reality .\nIn short one could say that technology has certainly been a blessing for mankind. There should, however, be some control on it, too often man is abused by technology. It\'s high time to do something about the morbid growth of technology and to try and seek for a system that protects society and its members .\n'}"

CHARLES SPENCER

A. Tamburlaine the Great

Marlowe's ten-act epic about the all-conquering warrior can seem never-ending, but it emerges as one of the most thrilling nights of the year in Terry Hands' staging. He has hacked great chunks from the text and offers a production that combines the glories of Marlowe's play with an exhilarating speed and physicality. Antony Sher is in terrific form in the title role, somersaulting from the balcony, sliding down a rope head-first as he delivers a speech, demanding and getting the audience's complete attention as his eyes glint with a mad lust for power and glory. Great stuff.
Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon (01789 295623)

B. Women Laughing

Welcome London transfer for the late Michael Wall's fine play, seen at the Manchester Royal Exchange in May. The first act creates an atmosphere of unsettling menace as two married couples chat on a sunny suburban lawn. In the second half the location shifts and the piece becomes a powerful, compassionate study of the devastating effects of illness. The British theatre lost a talent of great promise when Wall died at the tragically early age of 44.
Royal Court Theatre, London SW1 (0207 730 1745)

C. Amphibians

Billy Roche is the latest in the long line of Irish dramatists to have enriched the English stage. All his plays to date have been set in his native Wexford, and this latest piece explores the decline of the fishing industry with his usual mixture of rich characterisation, painful emotion and sudden moments of quirky humour. The play sprawls a bit aimlessly at times, but builds to a blistering climax.
Barbican 3 Pit Theatre, London EC2 (0207 638 8891)

D. Murder by Misadventure

Traditional thriller involving our old friend, 'the perfect murder'. This time it is Gerald Harper and William Gaunt who play the crime-writing partnership intent on killing each other, and though its all rather familiar stuff; the twists and turns are handled with ingenuity.
Whitehall Theatre, London SW1 (0207 867 1119)

E. The Alchemist

Young director Sam Mendes finds the gold in Jonson's great comedy of 17th-century confidence tricksters. First seen at the Swan in Stratford last year, the show works just as well on the Barbican's main stage, with Jonathan Hyde, David Bradley and Joanne Pearce repeating their fine performances as the wicked trio of con-artists.
Barbican Theatre, London EC2 (0207 638 8891)

F. The Madras House

Peter James' production of Harley Granville Barkers rich, panoramic comedy about fashion and the position of women in Edwardian society transfers to London after its success at the Edinburgh Festival. The staging is stylish, the acting excellent, the play itself an unjustly neglected classic.
Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, London W6 (0208 741 2311)

G. Dreams from a summer house

This delightful new musical finds playwright Alan Ayckbourn in unusually benign form as he relocates the Beauty and the Beast story deep in the heart of London suburbia. A lush score by John Pattison and an unashamedly schmaltzy celebration of romantic love combine to make this good-hearted show a real winner. London impresarios looking for a hit should board the next train to Scarborough.
Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough (01 723 370541)

H. The Merry Wives of Windsor

David Thacker's lacklustre production of Shakespeare's most farcical comedy came perilously close to being awarded the dreaded thumbs-down symbol, but this disappointing, crudely designed show is redeemed by first-rate comic performances from Ron Cook as the French physician Dr Caius and Anton Lesser as the explosively jealous husband, Ford. Almost everyone else looks faintly embarrassed, as well they might.
Shakespeare Theatre, Stragford-upon-Avon (01789 295623)

I. The Voysey Inheritance

Another major Granville Barker revival, now touring the regions. This story of an apparently respectable solicitor who bequeaths a corrupt financial legacy to his son results in a marvellous play.

"Seven Up

Mountaineer Doug Scott shares with his readers the mystical experience of conquering the highest peak on each continent: the Seven Summits.

My quest to climb the Seven Summits came late in life. I will take them in the order of my climbing them.

A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)

We were in a snow cave 91m below the summit when my climbing partner, Dougal Haston, began a conversation with Dave Clark, our Equipment Officer, about the relative merits of various sleeping bags. I thought this was strange, as only Dougal and I were present. Putting this down to oxygen deprivation, I then found myself talking to my feet. Already the cold was getting into the balls of my feet and I recalled other climbers who had lost fingers and toes from frostbite. It wasn't survival that was worrying us so much as the quality of our survival.
Over the next two days I relived our time spent on the summit ridge. I realised that I couldn't have been there with a better man than Dougal Hatton. He inspired great confidence in me and by now I was climbing with a calm presentiment mat somehow or other it was all going to work out. I realised I had to get a better rhythm going in order to reach the summit - which is what I did.

B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)

This mountain is regarded as the most treacherous in the world. In April 1976 Dougal and I arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days humping equipment and food up to the base. Only after the first day of climbing did we realise the enormity of our undertaking. On the lower face we followed a route put up in 1967, but at half height we pursued a new route, as planned, heading directly for the upper snow basin and the summit. We decided to climb
'alpine style', with our equipment and food on our backs. It would be the first time a major new route had been climbed here in such a way.
We climbed up the compressed snow of an avalanche scar to camp under a rocky cliff and by the third day my sleeping bag was sodden. We spent the third night on a windswept ridge; by now we were both suffering. Mt. McKinley, because the air pressure in the polar regions is lower, has an impact on the body out of all proportion to its altitude. It seemed to us that we were up at around 7,000m, instead of 6,100m. We packed our bags and finally staggered onto the summit and down the other side, triumphant.

C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,89Sm)

In September 1976, Paul Braithwaite and I flew to Nairobi with the intention of climbing Mt. Kenya. It was though the unexpected offer of a free ride to the Tanzanian side of Kilimanjaro that we came to climb Africa's highest mountain.
On our approach we got ourselves lost in the dense jungles of the lower slopes. Our situation became serious because water is scarce. On the second day we came across luminous arrows painted on trees and a trail of rubbish which brought us to a rock pool. Never before had I been so pleased to find rubbish on a mountain.
We attempted a direct start to the breach wall, which is a 305m-high icicle. After a deluge of falling rock and ice we prudently retired and opted instead for the Umbwe route to gain the surrealistic summit.

D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)

The original and now standard route up Aconcagua is little more than a walk. In January 1992, I arrived with my wife, Sharu, at Punta del Inca and was pleasantly surprised to meet fellow mountaineer and guide, Phil Erscheler. He was taking a party up the mountain via the Polish Glacier, away from the busy standard route, and suggested that we go with them.
After three days of sitting out bad weather, we left base camp. The Polish Glacier stretching up to the summit had been swept by vicious winds and glistened with pure ice. With a time limit to get back to Buenos Aires for our flight, we decided to miss out on the glacier. Instead we went across the north ridges towards the standard route and joined the large number of people wandering along the path. The wind was strong as we walked the last few metres to the summit and just before it got dark we camped outside the refuge.
Back at base camp we met eight members of the Jakarta Mountaineering Club. They were planning to climb the Seven Summits and felt, when they learnt that I had already climbed four, that I should do me same. This was the first time I had seriously thought about such goal-orientation -- something I had previously tried to avoid.

E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)

When I learnt that climbing Vinson Massif was just a matter of guiding enough people in order to finance the cost of getting there, attempting all of the Seven Summits became a reality. Our team left Britain towards the end of November 1992 and travelled the thousands of kilometres to the South Pole. At this time of the year the sun is always well above the horizon, throughout the day and night, and when the wind stops blowing it is utterly quiet. As in other polar regions, in the keen, clean air, there is such an invigorating atmosphere that the spirits are raised just by being there. On December 7 we left camp and headed off towards the summit. Against expectations, with winds gusting at around 80 kms per hour and temperatures below minus 50degC, we all got to the top within 8 hours. Our elation was somewhat tempered by visibility being down to just a few metres in the storm.

F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)

Our team assembled in St Petersburg during the early summer of 1994. On our arrival at the settlement of Terskol, beneath Elbrus, a commission was demanded from our guide for bringing foreigners into the valley, though this was later waived. 
After a few days' acclimatising, the group set off up Elbrus by cableway to 3,900m. From there we walked to the refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, the wind buffered us as we crossed open slopes, some of them glassy ice. By mid-
afternoon we reached what we thought was the summit. But we found there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit. As night fell, we returned to the refuge and the next day descended this, fortunately extinct, volcano.

G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)

On our expedition to Carstensz we hoped not only to establish a new route but to spend as much time as possible with the aboriginal Dani people. The largest gold mine in the world is cutting into the mountain, regarded as sacred by the local tribespeople.
We had been warned that we might be taken hostage or even killed by bandits but, undeterred, we left our hut by mid-morning and walked down winding lanes towards the jungle. On May 12 we stayed climbing. The weather improved and two of the team hared ahead. We were slower, since Sham was filming. Climbing in rock shoes, we reached the summit by 11 am. 
I was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit.

Our elation was somewhat tempered by visibility being down to just a few metres in the storm.\n\nF. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)\n\nOur team assembled in St Petersburg during the early summer of 1994. On our arrival at the settlement of Terskol, beneath Elbrus, a commission was demanded from our guide for bringing foreigners into the valley, though this was later waived. \nAfter a few days' acclimatising, the group set off up Elbrus by cableway to 3,900m. From there we walked to the refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, the wind buffered us as we crossed open slopes, some of them glassy ice. By mid-\nafternoon we reached what we thought was the summit. But we found there was another kilometre-long ridge to the actual summit. As night fell, we returned to the refuge and the next day descended this, fortunately extinct, volcano.\n\nG. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)\n\nOn our expedition to Carstensz we hoped not only to establish a new route but to spend as much time as possible with the aboriginal Dani people. The largest gold mine in the world is cutting into the mountain, regarded as sacred by the local tribespeople.\nWe had been warned that we might be taken hostage or even killed by bandits but, undeterred, we left our hut by mid-morning and walked down winding lanes towards the jungle. On May 12 we stayed climbing. The weather improved and two of the team hared ahead. We were slower, since Sham was filming. Climbing in rock shoes, we reached the summit by 11 am. \nI was given a standing ovation on this, my seventh summit. Mission accomplished!""}"
"Interest groups also provide a channel for representation, although few people recognize this. Indeed, most Americans think that interest groups (or “special interests” as they are pejoratively termed) have too much power and do more harm than good.

"Drop me a line! 

In our fast world of phones, fax machines and computers, the old-fashioned art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing altogether. Yet, to me, there is something about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and, finally, the enjoyment of the contents. 
Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother, also, always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were as long as they were letters. 
When I left home at 18 to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a 
week, and so would my mother. Occasionally my father would write and it was always a joy to receive his long, amusing letters. Most of the letters from home contained just everyday events concerning my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls but it is the letters I remember most. 
There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away at some time and I was only able to stay in touch by correspondence. But instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to improve them. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking.
I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are appreciated, but how much better to have a year's supply of news! And it's better still when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters arrive from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. 
Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More important, if she hadn't replied, we would be the poorer for it. As it is, we now have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice and she has stayed with us. 
My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer, when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been corresponding for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local press even considered the correspondence worth reporting on the front page. 
I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Just a few words before...
When we speak about feminism we always get very different opinions, even among those who call themselves feminists. Some of these opinions can sometimes be controversial. Considering myself a non - archetypal feminist, my own opinions could happen to be a bit contradictory sometimes .
The examples I'll mention in this essay will be mainly referred to feminism in Spain and England, as I have more points of reference with regard to this two countries .
Talkinq about feminism .
One of the most important protest campaigns in Britain was the Suffragette Movement. At the beginning of this century women couldn't vote in British elections. The Suffragettes wanted to change this. We will never know how successful the Suffragettes were, because in 1914 the First World War started and the protests were stopped. During the war many men's jobs were done by women, because men were in the army. The war changed people's ideas about many things. When it ended in 1918 the vote was given to all men over twenty - one and to women over the age of thirty. A few years later it was given to all adults over the age of twenty-one .
There has been similar movements in other countries and women have been, little by little, gaining ground. But it's still true in some places that women have to carry on jobs which, historically, have always been asigned to males, like farming, working in the fields, etc, and have, at the same time, to do the housework, taking care of the kids, etc .
It's not only in the country that women have to develop these multiple roles. An average family nowadays consists on a ""he"", who, whether has or doesn't have a job, uses to let all the housework be done by ""her"", and occasionally gives a hand in enough simple tasks to keep his brain safe against headaches; and a ""she', who can sometimes stupidly assure, very proudly, she is a ""superwoman"", and therefore can afford all sacrifice and work twenty five hours a day, going to work, taking care of ""he"" and the kids, and showing everybody her shiny kitchen, and taking his time as well, to do the shopping, having coffee (or whatever) with her mates, and ocasionally having time to spend with a nice lover that offers her all that necessary things (???) that ""he"" can not give her .
This examples only come to show there is still a lot of work to be done, and what real feminists should try do do first is to change female's mind, and then do the same with the male's, ' cos there's no way we could change something unfair if we, women, are not the first ones who become aware of what is fair or not, and the only way of stopping them patronizing us, either considering us as fragile china miniatures, or simple ""bimbos"" (sexual objects whith an absolute lack of brains).
And that's why, in my opinion, the first feminists did a lot of good to the cause of women, getting for us at least to be considered as people (that is, animals with a brain able to think and decide, for instance, which politician would, in our opinion, do less harm to our country).
Feminism nowadays is another story, specially when talking about Spain. Objectives are not that clear, victories are not that convincing and there are some not too obvious points, like the abortion law, even for some who consider themselves as feminists. This law was a victory of feminism in England a long time ago. In fact, if that country advantages us in something, it is in showing consideration for women and respecting and even imposing women's rights, although it's still a long way off the day we will see thousand of us elected to ministers, to Parliament and the European Parliament, the day we won't suffer any kind of discrimination .
Anyway, although I don't think feminists are doing any harm to the cause of women, I do believe the kind of propaganda some feminist groups of them use to display is not effective at all. Each womann has to realise she can fight her particular battle on her own, not showing everybody how week they are and joining groups to get stronger .",B2,"{'title': '430_SPM02011.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good \n \nJust a few words before...\nWhen we speak about feminism we always get very different opinions, even among those who call themselves feminists.

"And certainly Catherine's education could not be described as appropriate for a heroine. In fact, she had an obvious dislike for the classroom and never could learn or understand anything before she was taught; occasionally she even seemed rather stupid. 
Her mother wanted her to learn music and Catherine was sure that she would like to play the piano, so at eight years old she began lessons. But she soon gave up, and the day on which the music teacher was dismissed was one of the happiest days of her young life. Her drawing ability was also disappointing; although she enjoyed drawing animals, all her pictures, from chickens to horses, looked very similar. 
What a strange, incomprehensible character! Incomprehensible because, in spite of such clear signs of a difficult nature, Catherine was seldom unpleasant; she rarely quarrelled and was very kind to her six younger brothers and sisters and quite friendly with the three older ones. But it still must be admitted that she was untidy, noisy and wild and loved nothing better than rolling down her favourite hill at the back of the house. 
At fifteen, Catherine's appearance began to improve; her skin was brighter, her hair was shinier and nicely styled, her eyes shone and her figure was pleasing. Her love of dirt was replaced by an interest in the latest fashions and in the possibility of going to a ball.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
In all probability university students wonder whether or not they spend their time uselessly in studying through four or five years in order to take their degree. it is necessary to underline that there are some university degrees which are more theoretical than practical and which aim more at enriching culturally student ' minds than preparing them to enter the real world. The university degrees which are more theoretical than practical are the Art Faculties degrees such as degree in History, Philosophy, Modern and Classical Languages; on the contrary university degrees which are more practical than Art Faculties are Medical Faculty, Engeneering Faculty and Business Administration Faculty .
The degrees in Medicine and Business Administration give the possibility to students to do training courses in hospitals and in enterprises in order to help them to become more familiar with the world of business. Take the instance of Arianna Cataldo, a friend of mine who last year took her degree in Business Administration and now works as secretary in an enterprise in Turin. During her four years university course, she had to do training courses in different enterprises where she learnt to use computers and to keep enterprises accountings. Consequently, last year when she obtained her degree, she quickly found a job as secretary in one of the four enterprises where she worked during training courses .
In the medicine Faculty, students are obliged to do practical courses in hospitals, in fact it is not sufficient to pass all theoretical exams to get a degree in Medicine. Take the instance of Marcella Vittorini, a friend of mine who would obtain a degree in Medicine. Every day she does practical hours at the C.T.O Hospital of Turin. She tells me that practical hours are very usefull in order to understand better medical theories and to understand in what consist the doctor's work. She find practical courses very important in order to become more familiar with her future work .
In general, Arts Faculties initiate students into the teaching career. People are persuaded that being a teacher is easier than being a secretary and consequently they are convinced that practical courses are unnecessary. Take the instance of Jane Morris: ten years ago Jane got a first-class honours degree in history at Cambridge University and two years ago she found a job as history teacher in a Secondary School in London. Last year she was dismissed because the students complained to the headmaster about the fact that she was not able to explain the historical events .
She never explained History but obliged her students to study it on books by themselves .
Consequently, the dismissal of Jane gave rise to controversies about the fact that the Humanities degrees are more theoretical than practical . Final year students should have the possibility to do temporary teaching jobs or should work as teachers' assistants in order to become more friendly with students but above all with the subject which they are going to teach in future .
As far as modern languages degree is concerned, it lacks in specialized courses which may be useful to students who are going to find a job as interpreter in enterprises. the languages courses focus their attention more on literature than on language. In fact there are more literature exams than language ones. Moreover there are not courses about Business English, Business French, Business German or Business Spanish which I consider essential in order to find a job as interpreter .
furthermore, there are no computer courses or courses specialized in translations. When you have an interview the employer does not ask you to talk about Shakespeare or Oscar Wilde, but he usually asks you whether or not you know how to use a computer and whether or not you are familiar with business English, for instance. Take the instance of my aunt Emilia. She took her degree in English language ten years ago. When she went for an interview, she was not recruited because she was unfamiliar with Business English and computers. The employer preferred to recruit a girl who only held a school-learning certificate but who was excellent in using computers and in writing Business English .

"Title: Is everyone really equal? 

 Financial compensation should be an element paid for efforts and abilities to produce as much as one can. In my opinion, a man/woman's financial reward should be commensurate with their contribution to the society they live in. The compensation one receives should be appropriate with ultimate result. The more person is paid the better production at his/her workplace could be achieved, because financial reward is an effective motivator to do a job properly .
 Fair and reasonable financial reward is relevant for good morale at a workplace. Moreover, positive effects also come from good compensation. To illustrate, sometimes a very efficient staff do not produce as much as they are capable of. The low salary tapers off their efficiency and abilities to obtain the highest effect. However, employer expects them to work hard whole time, no matter how much they are paid. Therefore, they should be paid for what they produce. The harder they work, the more they should be paid. Besides, some extra financial reward would motivate them to achieve more fecundity .
 Employers should ensure that their organizations and businesses provide financial reward to their personnel for the contribution to the production. I think this has to be understood by employers in the first place. This leads a person to bigger motivation. Everyone wants to have a well paid work, be employed for good salary. However, I think a certain level of income should be associated with the endeavor to encompass the goal. For instance, man/woman given a specific work task may be passive, unenthusiastic if work is quite monotonous and repetitious. If the financial reward is attractive the one will complete the task efficiently putting all the efforts, because people think that money is a motivator. It really has an effect .
 Wages are normally paid per hour worked and workers receive money at the end of the week. Furthermore, sometimes other system of financial reward is used, paying only two times per month. It is very simple and easy to use for businesses. However, workers may be resent being paid the same salary as their colleagues who they feel are not so productive. Thus, I am inclined to believe that, the employee should be paid per item produced. In this way everyone would receive the compensation they deserved, the working atmosphere would be pleasant and the relationships between workers would be good, avoiding complaints of inequality. This also would give reason to manufacture more in order to earn extra, because no one could imagine his/her life without money. It is our source of better life, the way to more interesting and satisfactory life .
 To sum up, this argumentative essay introduces and briefly illustrates my point of view concerning a man/woman's financial reword. I strongly agree with the statement that financial reward should be proportionate with the contribution.

"Title: Should criminals be imprisoned or rehabilitated? 
 
	It is said that society gets the criminals it deserves. There is no such thing as crime free country, but how criminals are treated may change their lives, the whole system and the country's future as well. Certain approach will give certain results, but what is the right one? Should criminals be imprisoned or rehabilitated?
	There are several names such as prison, detention center, correctional facility, jail, penitentiary etc. all for the same facility in which people are detained by force and sentenced to serve for a certain period due to the seriousness of the crime they had committed. Today's prison system is similar with the old established system centuries ago. Once the state was formed as a civil organization and the written language evolved, codes and rules were set as a legal base for well and rightful society. Every disobedience resulted in legal measure and punishment. Poverty, as a background for most of the crimes committed, is also a reason for the rise of the prison facility. In the past, if people broke the rules, they were supposed to pay a fine to the country, however, because of the great poverty, they were unable to pay the fines and the authorities set the imprisonment as a recompense. Imprisonment, than and still today, stays for punishment, but, not only for punishment - for power and authority as well. It is a way of showing how the country can execute its power by punishing. For instance we can take The Stanford Prison Experiment which is a study conducted by researchers led by Philip Zimbardo, psychology professor, in 1971 at Stanford University, California. This study dealt with the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard, so, half of the participants took the first role, the other half the second. In this paragraph we will focus on the second group, the prison guards, and the effects and the consequences of their role in the study. Professor Zimbardo took only mentally stable and nonviolent students for taking part in his study, but very shortly it was noticeable that the guards started to act really brutally and sadistic towards the prisoners. They insulted them, gave them pointless task to do, harassed them in any possible manner just because so, no need or any sensible reason behind that. This, of course, led to change in the prisoners' behavior - not in the positive way though . [Reference] The importance of this study is that has shown how this type of behavior and surrounding affect prisoners. Even though this is just a study simulating prison life and imprisonment, it is a reflection of reality indeed. Criminals are changed in prison, but for worse, and once they get out of there are even bigger threat than before.
	On the other hand, rehabilitation means restoring something to its original state and when it comes to people it means assisting to return to their normal, healthy life. Rehabilitation is mainly associated with institutions made for people who had an injury, surgery, trauma or suffer from some mental illness and this type of institution led by doctors and professionals help them to recover. Obviously, criminals do suffer from some kind of disturbance since they commit crimes not applicable to the common sense. Rehabilitation will help the criminals to overcome their personal issues, it will help them to socialize again, to cherish the right values and not to be harmful for the people surrounding them. This process is really important in dealing with criminals because it will open a new horizon and opportunities, it will help them during the legal act not to feel only punished and humiliated, but it will make them understand and willful to change. The aforementioned Stanford study was mainly aimed to show the changes in prisoners' behavior and the conclusion was that even mentally stable people in that type of surrounding started to act submissively, to show signs of depression, emotional disorder, to lose their own identity and identify with the prison life. Some of the participants had to leave the study because they could not endure longer and it might have led to permanent health damage. These consequences are the opposite of what the prison's purpose should be. Criminals are people who need help and what should be done is a rehabilitation implementation.
	When we talk about crimes and the reasons behind, and the purposes for, and the degree of the crime - we can only judge and criticize as passive observers, not being aware that behind every crime lies a mental and emotional disturbance as undeniable core. The long lasting imprisonment practice did not give positive results, maybe a new approach will improve the system and certainly it will benefit society as a whole .",C1,"{'title': '320_MDCM3041.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: Should criminals be imprisoned or rehabilitated? \n \n\tIt is said that society gets the criminals it deserves.

For instance we can take The Stanford Prison Experiment which is a study conducted by researchers led by Philip Zimbardo, psychology professor, in 1971 at Stanford University, California. This study dealt with the psychological effects of becoming a prisoner or prison guard, so, half of the participants took the first role, the other half the second. In this paragraph we will focus on the second group, the prison guards, and the effects and the consequences of their role in the study. Professor Zimbardo took only mentally stable and nonviolent students for taking part in his study, but very shortly it was noticeable that the guards started to act really brutally and sadistic towards the prisoners. They insulted them, gave them pointless task to do, harassed them in any possible manner just because so, no need or any sensible reason behind that. This, of course, led to change in the prisoners' behavior - not in the positive way though . [Reference] The importance of this study is that has shown how this type of behavior and surrounding affect prisoners. Even though this is just a study simulating prison life and imprisonment, it is a reflection of reality indeed. Criminals are changed in prison, but for worse, and once they get out of there are even bigger threat than before.\n\tOn the other hand, rehabilitation means restoring something to its original state and when it comes to people it means assisting to return to their normal, healthy life. Rehabilitation is mainly associated with institutions made for people who had an injury, surgery, trauma or suffer from some mental illness and this type of institution led by doctors and professionals help them to recover. Obviously, criminals do suffer from some kind of disturbance since they commit crimes not applicable to the common sense. Rehabilitation will help the criminals to overcome their personal issues, it will help them to socialize again, to cherish the right values and not to be harmful for the people surrounding them. This process is really important in dealing with criminals because it will open a new horizon and opportunities, it will help them during the legal act not to feel only punished and humiliated, but it will make them understand and willful to change. The aforementioned Stanford study was mainly aimed to show the changes in prisoners' behavior and the conclusion was that even mentally stable people in that type of surrounding started to act submissively, to show signs of depression, emotional disorder, to lose their own identity and identify with the prison life. Some of the participants had to leave the study because they could not endure longer and it might have led to permanent health damage. These consequences are the opposite of what the prison's purpose should be. Criminals are people who need help and what should be done is a rehabilitation implementation.\n\tWhen we talk about crimes and the reasons behind, and the purposes for, and the degree of the crime - we can only judge and criticize as passive observers, not being aware that behind every crime lies a mental and emotional disturbance as undeniable core. The long lasting imprisonment practice did not give positive results, maybe a new approach will improve the system and certainly it will benefit society as a whole . \n""}"

"Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
Prison system in history, the imprisonments for creating a safer society .
Many people are tortured in the prisons in every country 
Police behaviour is harsh and rude with prisoners. No respect of rules, justices and humanity
Different non political NGO's are active and working for the prisoner's rights . 
We need to have equality, justice and opportunities for progress available to all the people. Otherwise we cann't hope to have a society free from crimes and criminals .

There has been this belief by governments that the more imprisonment is the better for creating a safer society. There are more than 37 prisons only in Punjab. And their capacity is to have only few hundered prisoners but these prisons are over crowded due to more imprisonments. The situation is not so much different in other countries like, America, England and Australia. As the figures released by the Australian Bureau of statistics reveal that almost 60 percent of people in prisons last year had been in jail before . 
Generally, the prisons are over crowded, therefore, the prisoners quarrel with the jail staff and the other prisoners and get injuries e.g fifty prisoners were injured in a clash at central jail in Faisalabad only few months ago. The prisoners are not treatened very well and they are tortured both mentally and physically, e.g, In Guantanamo jail in America, where there is no respect of humanity, rules and justice. And at the end of this torture some prisoners die and mostly became psychological patients and these problems of mental disorder cut off them from the society. There is no proper system of food for prisoners. They are treatened harshly and rudely . 
The government's belief that the society will be safe if more people who commit crimes are imprisoned, is not right because the police are quite rude and harsh when they raid private quarters or other places for the purpose of search or arrest. They often beat up the people to much who resist them or hinder the search or arrest. Sometimes, they injure the wanted people badly or even kill them and the news later appears as ""killed in police encounter"". 
They arrest the youth, women and children illegally and lock up them under different rules e.g. under 302, 307, 392, 420 and 337 etc. They torture them in prisons. Respect for women and sympathy for children are also at time not shown by the police. Then after releasing from prisons, they commit crimes as a revenge and have to go to prisons once again. There are more than 6,56, 700 prisoners only in Punjab. Prison system is outdated. Prison is not something that's effectively dealing with the social problems that deal to crime or individual problems but that might lead a particular individuals to committing offences . 
Physical punishments and mental torture can not work as love, sympathy and justice can do. We should provide justice to the prisoners and try to releas them from prisons. And needless delays in justice in courts should be avoided like wildfire. New laws should be farmed to meet new situations . 
No civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate. In this respect different non-political NGOs are active for the prisoner's rights.e.g, Ansar Burney's welfare trust in Lahore, with prisoners' legal Aid society, is working on self help basis. Therefore, the violation of human rights by the US and Britain in their treatment of Iraqi prisoners in 2004 and earlier remained in hot debate in the mass media .
The police and the governments have realized the need of the hour that society should try to rehabilitate its prisoners rather than to punish and torture them. In this regard, US President Barack Obama has promised to close the controversial prison Guantanamo and to end the torture system .
In Pakistan, the judges of different districts have asked the civil judges to provide defence council for the prisoners, who cannot hire the lawyers to plea their cases .

"Satire is the art of mocking those in power. To do this you need freedom of speech, a right which has its roots in Magna Carta of 1215. Satire is much older than that though - it's been around since ancient Greece.
Using your right to free speech in this way also means you run the risk of offending somebody. This can have tragic consequences, like the terrorist attacks in Paris on the staff of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
Satirists can highlight inequality and injustices in a society by using humour to exaggerate them. But pointing out that a problem exists is only the first step. Can satire really change how our politicians rule the country? To see how satire developed in Britain, we need to go back to the 18th Century.
Satire really took off in Britain during the 18th Century as the House of Commons and the prime minister began to draw additional powers away from the monarchy. Both became targets for the pens of satirists. To modern eyes some of these attacks are surprisingly vicious.
The notoriously corrupt prime minster Robert Walpole was compared to a highwayman in one opera.
Jonathan Swift highlighted the poverty in Ireland and subsequent famines with the shocking spoof proposal that the Irish should eat their babies. This led to public debate but Ireland's woes were to continue and worsen.
Yet it was a cartoonist who really had the powerful quaking in their boots. James Gillray's satirical cartoons were reprinted in newspapers and cleverly mocked politicians and the monarchy.
Gillray was so good at satire that he was even hired by the Tories to attack their rivals, the Whigs. One Tory complimented him by saying: ""You have been of infinite service in lowering them, and making them ridiculous.""",B2,"{'title': 'text_206.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Satire is the art of mocking those in power.

"Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success
Daniel Goleman examines the 'people skills' that are essential for a place at the top of your profession
A
The rules for work are changing, We are being judged by a new yardstick - not just by how clever we are, or by our training and expertise, but also by how well we handle ourselves and each other. This yardstick is increasingly used in choosing who will be hired and who will not, who will be passed over and who will not. The new rules can he used to indicate who is likely to become a star performer and who is more prone to mediocrity. And, no matter what field we work in currently, they measure the trait- that are crucial to our marketability for future jobs, These rules have little to do with what we were told at school was important. The ability to do well in examinations is largely irrelevant to this standard. The new measure takes it for granted that we all have enough intellectual ability and technical knowhow to do our jobs. It focuses instead on social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative and empathy, adaptability and persuasiveness - the 'people skills' that make up what is now commonly referred to as emotional intelligence.
B
In a time when few guarantees of job security have led to the very concept of a 'job' being rapidly replaced by ‘portable skills', personal qualities begin to play an important role in the workplace. Talked about loosely for decades under a variety of names, from 'character' and 'personality' to 'soft skills', there is, at last, a more precise understanding of these human talents as well as a new name tor them. 'Emotional intelligence' is generally defined as the ability to monitor and regulate one’s own and others' feelings, and to use feelings to guide thought and action. In our work-life it comprises basic elements: self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy and adeptness in social relationships. There is a common assumption that it simply means ‘being nice', However, at strategic moments it may demand not ‘being nice', but rather, for example, bluntly confronting someone with the uncomfortable truth. Nor does emotional intelligence mean giving free rein to feelings - 'letting it all hang out’. Rather, it means managing feeling so that they are expressed appropriately and effectively, enabling people to work together smoothly towards their common goal.
C
More and more businesses are seeing that encouraging emotional intelligence skills is a viral component of management philosophy. And the less straightforward the job, the more emotional intelligence matters - if only because a deficiency in these abilities can hinder the use of whatever technical expertise or intellect a person may have. There are many examples of people who have risen to the top notwithstanding flaws in emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and collaborative, companies where people work together best have a competitive edge. In the new workplace, with its emphasis on teamwork and a strong customer orientation, this crucial set of emotional competencies is becoming increasingly essential for excellence in every job and in every part of the world.
D
Whereas one's IQ undergoes few changes, emotional intelligence continues to develop as we go through life and learn from our experiences: our competence in it can keep growing. In fact, studies that have measured people's emotional intelligence through the years show that most people grow more adept at handling their own emotions and impulses, at motivating themselves and at honing their empathy and social adroitness. There is an old-fashioned word for this growth in emotional intelligence: maturity. Not only can emotional intelligence be learnt, but individually we can add these skills to our tool kit for survival. This is especially relevant at a time when it seems a contradiction to put the words ‘job' and 'stability’ together. Emotional intelligence is no magic formula for uncompetitive organisations, no guarantee of more market share or a healthier bottom line.

"Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 
 
When God made the human race he made all the humans equal, Equal in their possessions, minds, absolutely everything. But I guess that when God mixed the mixture he put a wrong ingredient too without noticing. And it spoiled everything, it transformed into a flow of the first men. Then he condemned us and it was inherited by the following generations .
As a whole we the humans are a cursed race. It is deeply rooted in us to kill, to steal, to lie .
Sooner or later it all comes out. We've been living on that planet for thousands of years now but there are certain things which will never change. One of them is the evil rooted in us. George Orwell was right because he was writing what he was seeing, he was writing reality. The present time is not much different from the time before two hundred years for instance. The bad people have always been bad and the good people have always been at the bottom. This is mostly true today in the 21st century when the driving force behind every person is the personal success at the expense of the others. Well, almost every person. The people who think only of their wealth think they are something more than the others, they think they can do whatever they want - these are the people we call ""more equal"".
Orwell's comparison of humans to animals is perfectly adequate. Because what are we? We are claimed to be the highest animal kind. Like them we are often guided by the instinct of self - preservation which makes us do bad things to others. Makes us neglect others, betray them, hurt them. When we follow that instinct we are blind for everything else but our survival. Another reason that makes people think they are ""special"" is money. Yes, the powerful money. They can put a man high in the clouds and block his common sense. When a person has money they think that the world is their, that it belongs to them. And what happens when they get a lot of money?
They become the world's best creatures. And want more and more money, this is loftiness and arrogance come from, from their sense of superiority and importance .
Yet another reason would be if a person has a right social position. For instance, a congressman, a TV journalist, a rich banker. They watch people from above. The ""special"", ""more equal people"" are everywhere, there isn't a certain place where they could be found, they are all around us. Of course, there are people who don't have any basis for their arrogance and ""speciality"".
Yes, Orwell couldn't has been more right than. People are cruel, they kill each other, they destroy their lives.

"The World's End murder trial.
The 2007 acquittal of Angus Sinclair, later revealed as a serial killer, sparked a profound change in Scotland's judicial system.
Sinclair was cleared of raping and killing two teenage girls after they left Edinburgh's World's End pub in October 1977. At the trial the prosecutor had failed to put vital forensic evidence before the jury, but by law Sinclair could not be tried twice for the same crime. The case led to legislation in 2011 which allowed this given 'compelling new evidence'. Sinclair was tried again in 2014, convicted and jailed. England and Wales ended double jeopardy in 2003, and Northern Ireland in 2005.
Trial in secret.
In 1923 Lord Chief Justice Hewart coined the phrase: 'Not only must justice be done; it must also be seen to be done.'
This key legal principle was challenged in 2014 when the Crown Prosecution Service sought to stage an Old Bailey trial in total secrecy. When this bid was overturned by the Court of Appeal the trial, of 26-year-old suspected London terrorist Erol Incedal, was held in partial secrecy. Some evidence was heard completely in secret.

"0ral History

The growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems. It is naive to suppose that someone's testimony represents a pure distillation of past experience, for in an interview each party is affected by the other. It is the historian who selects the informant and indicates the area of interest; and even if he or she asks no questions and merely listens, the presence of an outsider affects the atmosphere in which the informant recalls the past and talks about it. The end product is conditioned both by the historian's social position vis-a-vis the informant, and by the terms in which he or she has learnt to analyse the past and which may well be communicated to the informant. In other words, historians must accept responsibility for their share in creating new evidence. But the difficulties are far from over when the historian is removed from the scene. For not even the informant is in direct touch with the past. His or her memories may be contaminated by what has been absorbed from other sources (especially the media); they may be overlaid by nostalgia ('times were good then'), or distorted by a sense of grievance about deprivation in childhood, which only took root in later life. To anyone listening, the feelings and attitudes are often what lends conviction to the testimony, yet they may be the emotional residue of later events rather than the period in question.

Animal Science

There are two main approaches to animal science - the physiological and the whole animal. Physiologists are mainly interested in how the body works, that is, in how the nerves, muscles and sense organs are coordinated to produce complex behaviour. Those taking the 'whole animal' approach, although they are often interested in the mechanisms of 'behaviour', study the behaviour of the intact animal and the factors that affect it.
Within the 'whole animal' approach, a distinction is often made between psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists have traditionally worked in laboratories on the learning abilities of a restricted range of species, mainly rats and pigeons. Ethologists have been more concerned with the naturally occurring, unlearnt behaviour of animals, often in their wild habitats. Although this distinction still exists to some extent, there is now a fruitful coming together of the two.
Among these types, it is the physiologists who like to emphasise that their methods are the more fundamental. However, even if we knew how every nerve cell operated in the performance of some pattern of behaviour, this would not remove the need for us to study it at a behavioural level also. Behaviour has its own organisation and its own units mat we must use for its study. Trying to describe the nest-building behaviour of a bird in terms of the actions of individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a page of a book with a high-powered microscope.

The Social Sciences

A problem facing all students who come to study a social science for the first time is that they must do two things simultaneously. They must familiarise themselves with the substance or content of their new subject and, at the same time, they must learn the methodology of the subject. That is, they must become familiar not only with the knowledge and research findings which fill the textbooks but also with the methods by which the knowledge is obtained and organised, that is with the logical basis of the subject itself. The two elements are not separate; they are very closely related. Because we are all familiar with social life through our everyday experiences we may feel that the social sciences are very largely a matter of common-sense. But, as a look at any textbook will quickly indicate, though each of the social sciences is concerned with people in society, each discipline goes beyond common-sense understanding. Each discipline focuses on a particular aspect of social life, each uses particular methods of study and each employs its own set of concepts. It is this set of concepts, the most basic ideas in a subject, which constitutes the 'logical basis of the subject', which enables the social scientist to go beyond everyday common-sense and which distinguishes one discipline from another.

Classical Architecture

To the classical world, that of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture meant much more than the mere construction of buildings. 'Architecture', says the Roman architect Vitruvius, 'consists of Order, and of Arrangement, and of Proportion and Symmetry and Propriety and Distribution.' For several of these terms he gives a Greek equivalent: his definitions probably derived from an earlier Greek authority whose writings are lost to us. Utility and Function are not part of this definition, though in his book Vitruvius does go on to describe the best form and arrangements for different purposes of structure; but here, at the beginning, the aesthetic emphasis, architecture as an art, has priority. The origins of classical architecture are complex. There was obviously a long prehistory of basic construction, of hut habitations simple in form and material, both in Greece and Italy, which did not match up to Vitruvius' artistic requirements. Though these were, by definition, inartistic they nevertheless contributed an essential element of form, which persisted into the later sophisticated architectural concepts. However orate it may appear from the outside, in essence the classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut.",C2,"{'title': '30.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""0ral History\n\nThe growing trend for historians to rely on oral evidence is not without its problems.

"Margaret was aged just 13 when she married the 30-year-old King James IV.
In deference to her age, James kept his existing mistress. Margaret's first pregnancy was not for several years. They had six children together, but only one survived infancy, the future James V.
The marriage was supposed to seal the perpetual peace, but a decade later it was put to the test.
Margaret's brother Henry VIII was now the English king. When France went to war with England, James picked the French side and invaded Northumberland.
The pattern of Scotland's position throughout the 16th Century was confirmed, a satellite pulled between France and England.
James IV's decision led to disaster. His army was defeated at Flodden Field in 1513 and James was killed.
Margaret's young son was not old enough to be king, so she became regent of Scotland, and the first Tudor woman to rule a kingdom.
But her position was precarious. The Scots Council wanted a military leader, not a female regent.
The Scottish nobles wanted the powerful Duke of Albany to rule. He was next in line to the throne but Margaret feared that meant he might dispose of her sons and become king.
Margaret needed powerful backing to oppose Albany's return and planned to marry to get it.
She chose the Earl of Angus. He had a strong following, but when the news emerged of Margaret's marriage she lost her popularity as the King's widow, and under the terms of her late husband's will, her remarriage meant she also lost the regency.",C1,"{'title': 'text_252.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Margaret was aged just 13 when she\xa0married\xa0the 30-year-old King James IV.\nIn deference to her age, James kept his existing mistress.

"My name is Doctor Watson. I am writing this story about my friend, Mr Sherlock Holmes, the famous detective.
Sherlock Holmes lives at 221B Baker Street, in the middle of London. My story begins in Baker Street, one morning in 1889, when a man knocked on the door.
I heard the man say, 'Mr Holmes? My name is Dr Mortimer. I need your help.'
'Come in,' said Holmes. 'How can I help you?' 'I have a strange story to tell you, Mr Holmes,' said Dr Mortimer. 'My story is very strange. Perhaps you will not believe me.'
Dr Mortimer sat down. Sherlock Holmes and I listened to his story.
'I am a doctor and I work in the country,' said Dr Mortimer. 'I live and work on Dartmoor. And, as you know, Dartmoor is a large, wild place. There is only one big house on Dartmoor - Baskerville Hall. The owner of the house was Sir Charles Baskerville. I was his friend as well as his doctor.'
'I read of his death in The Times newspaper,' said Holmes.
'That was three months ago,' said Dr Mortimer. The newspaper reported his death, but it did not report all the facts.'
'Was there something strange about his death?' asked Sherlock Holmes.
'I am not certain,' said Dr Mortimer. 'There was a story about a curse on the Baskerville family. Sir Charles believed this old story.'

"At the beginning, all telephone connections were made by operators in the exchange, and this gave acceptable employment to women. After 1899, it was possible to connect using numbers on the phone, but the women were paid very little and their bosses saw no reason to change in a hurry. The Bell Company didn't use the new system until after the First World War.
The first international telephone line connected Paris and Brussels in 1887. By 1900, international services were being connected as well as local ones. This meant putting more wires under the ocean. Britain was connected to the continent of Europe in 1891. 
Although existing telegraph wires could be used, long-distance telephones needed stations to make the sound stronger along the line. New York wasn't connected to San Francisco until 1915. A radio connection between London and New York was made in 1927, although this depended on weather conditions. Similar connections were made to Australia and South America in 1930, and from that time the telephone was truly a world service, although it was expensive.

"Therefore, the British government began to get rid of preferential tariffs. The British called wheat “corn”. In 1846, they took away the Corn Laws that gave special rates for wheat to the colonies. This was good for Britain but bad for the colonies. British North America could not compete with cheaper wheat and timber from Europe. Many wheat farmers left their farms and moved to the United States. Timber companies also lost most of their business. This caused an economic bust.

"Key Points Credit 
To put it simply, credit is about borrowing money. Credit refers to the ability of a person or a business to borrow money from a lender with the intent, or promise, to pay the money back. 
With loans and credit cards, people are able to borrow the money they need in order to buy something now. 
Earning credit requires earning people’s trust. When you borrow money from a parent, guardian, neighbor or friend, you usually promise to pay it back by a certain time. They lend you the money because they trust you to keep your promise. The same holds true when you borrow from a bank. 
Taking personal responsibility is absolutely essential when it comes to credit. Taking personal responsibility means keeping your promise to pay back the money you owe. 
Not everyone can borrow money from a bank. Credit is a privilege – and it’s granted only to those who have demonstrated their ability to manage their money over time. This is called your credit history. 
You can establish credit by opening a savings or checking account and carefully managing it. Careful management of a checking account means you don’t write checks for more money than you have (which is known as writing bad checks). Lots of teens have already started the process of establishing credit by opening savings and checking accounts. Nearly two of every three teenagers of high school age have savings accounts, and about one in five has a checking account. 
Building good credit is the key to getting the things you want – a car, college education, or a house. It’s important to maintain a good credit history.",B1,"{'title': 'text_156.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Key Points Credit \nTo put it simply, credit is about borrowing money.

"THE SHELL ARTIST

At the age of 83 Peter Cooke has become a master of his art.

There are still many things that Peter Cooke would like to try his hand at - paper-making and feather-work are on his list. For the moment though, he will stick to the skill that he has been delighted to perfect over the past ten years: making delicate and unusual objects out of shells.
'Tell me if I am boring you,' he says, as he leads me round his apartment showing me his work. There is a fine line between being a bore and being an enthusiast, but Cooke need not worry: he fits into the latter category, helped both by his charm and by the beauty of the things he makes.
He points to a pair of shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace. 'I shan't be at all bothered if people don't buy them because I have got so used to them, and to me they're adorable. I never meant to sell my work commercially. Some friends came to see me about five years ago and said, ""You must have an exhibition - people ought to see these. We'll talk to a man who owns an art gallery"".' The result was an exhibition in London, at which 70 per cent of the objects were sold. His second exhibition opened at the gallery yesterday. Considering the enormous prices the pieces command - around PS2,000 for the ornaments an empty space above the fireplace would seem a small sacrifice for Cooke to make.
There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at PS225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists that he has nothing to do with the prices and is cheerily open about their level: he claims there is nobody else in the world who produces work like his, and, as the gallery-owner told him, 'Well, you're going to stop one day and everybody will want your pieces because there won't be any more.'
'I do wish, though,' says Cooke, 'that I'd taken this up a lot earlier, because then I would have been able to produce really wonderful things - at least the potential would have been there. Although the ideas are still there and I'm doing the best I can now, I'm more limited physically than I was when I started.' Still, the work that he has managed to produce is a long way from the common shell constructions that can be found in seaside shops. 'I have a miniature mind,' he says, and this has resulted in boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, little shaded pictures made from shells and baskets of astonishingly realistic flowers.
Cooke has created his own method and uses materials as and when he finds them. He uses the cardboard sent back with laundered shirts for his flower bases, a nameless glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker ('If it runs out, I don't know what I will do!') and washing-up liquid to wash the shells. 'I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,' he says of his working method, yet the attention to detail, colour gradations and symmetry he achieves look far from accidental.
Cooke's quest for beautiful, and especially tiny, shells has taken him further than his Norfolk shore: to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa and the Philippines, to name but a few of the beaches where he has lain on his stomach and looked for beauties to bring home. He is insistent that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who write him letters accusing him of stripping the world's beaches. 'When I am collecting shells, I hear people's great fat feet crunching them up far faster than I can collect them; and the ones that are left, the sea breaks up. I would not dream of collecting shells with living creatures in them or diving for them, but once their occupants have left, why should I not collect them?' If one bases this argument on the amount of luggage that can be carried home by one man, the sum beauty of whose work is often greater than its natural parts, it becomes very convincing indeed.",B2,"{'title': '18.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'THE SHELL ARTIST\n\nAt the age of 83 Peter Cooke has become a master of his art.\n\nThere are still many things that Peter Cooke would like to try his hand at - paper-making and feather-work are on his list.

"Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
What role does money play in human life? We can hear in words of one old song:"" Money is the root of all evil"". On the other hand a lot of people are persuaded that money assures happiness. I think it is not possible to characterize money in general. There are many points of view from which money can be looked on. I found three of them the most important : money as an essential part of life, money as a means how to make life happier and easier and money as temptation to the sin .
Money as a condition of human existence in today society has also the great influence on human freedom. The word "" freedom"" has different meaning than it had in the history. Man is free if he is not dependent on anybody. To be independent means to have enough money to be able to live. To live independently means to do whatever one wants to do and what is not against the law. Money assures that. If you have money you can buy whatever you want, you can travel wherever you want, you can realize your plans. To be financially independent means not to be afraid of what you will have for dinner tomorrow. The feeling of material security is the necessary condition for effective human activity. Everybody is aware of the value of money and does his best to have it enough. The quotation ""He who says money has no sense for human life does not mean his money but money of the others"" perfectly expresses human mentality. Money decides what place you take in the society. Money motivates people to work hard to have higher income .
Money has the power to make human life easier and more pleasant. It can even change life into paradise. This all depends on who treats the money. If people treat money in common sense it can help them to realize their dreams and to reach happiness. Everybody has different ideas on what happiness is. It can be a new car, travelling or a lot of pets. For somebody to feel happy means to help the others who need money more than the owner. By the human acts of donating money to the poor and sick people many human lives were saved .
Finally, negative human qualities can change money into the disaster. Money is the leading power of the world. People do anything to have money. Even though they can fairly work in classical way they prefer to earn money in various simplier ways - they steal, hazard with their and other's life even kill each other. Blind with the vision of wealth and better future they can not see the results of their acts - baffled fates of innocent people, baffled fates of themselves. Money works as a drug. If such a people feel how sweet it is to have money they want to have it all the time and they do everything for it. They steal and kill again and again. These people do not live normal life. They are victims of money. Not money is the root of all evil. The root of all evil is bad man with his negative qualities. Money serves as a means how to realise the evil. Money causes many disasters in family life. Because of money a perfect family can change into the pack of wolfs. Family tragedies are often caused by the question of inheritance. Children kill their parents, younger brother kills the older one, wife kills her husband. This all prove how strong position money has in human life. It has so big power that it can break the relations between the closest friends. Because of money the wars start. Because of money people do not live naturally. To gain money one has to learn to dissimilate, to trick, to lie. The lack of money causes human suffering even death. The example of this evil expresses the situation in the developing countries. Thousands of people die during one day because of famine which is caused by the poorness of the country .
Through ages mankind is characterized by the human qualities which were given to it by God. Positive qualities make the good and negative ones make the evil. Both together make the reality of life. This world has no chance to get rid of any of them. They are like energy - still constant only changing the forms. As I have mentioned money can not be characterized in general. The money in the hands of a wicked man causes the evil. An intelligent man, who knows what the real human values are, spends money in the positive way. So, money can not be characterized as a good or bad thing. It is just means by which we realize our life and fate .",C1,"{'title': '073_CZPR3023.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: In the words of the old song: \'Money is the root of all evil\' \n \nWhat role does money play in human life?

"I was dirty, smelly, hungry and somewhere beneath all that, suntanned. It was the end Inter-Rail holiday. My body couldn't take any more punishment. My mind couldn't deal with any more foreign timetables, currencies or languages. 
'Never again,' I said, as I stepped onto home ground. I said exactly the same thing the following year. And the next. All I had to do was buy one train ticket and, because I was under twenty-five years old, I could spend a whole month going anywhere I wanted in Europe. Ordinary beds are never the same once you've learnt to sleep in the corridor of a train, the rhythm rocking you into a deep sleep.
Carrying all your possessions on your back in a rucksack makes you have a very basic approach to travel, and encourages incredible wastefulness that can lead to burning socks that have become too [line 10: beginning] anti-social, and getting rid of books when finished. On the other hand, this way of looking at life line 10: end] is entirely in the spirit of Inter-Rail, for common sense and reasoning can be thrown out of the window along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to achieve this carefree attitude is one of those tickets in your hand. 
Any system that enables young people to travel through countries at a rate of more than one a day must be pretty special. On that first trip, my friends and I were at first unaware of the possibilities of this type of train ticket, thinking it was just an inexpensive way of getting to and from our chosen camp-site in southern France. But the idea of non-stop travel proved too tempting, for there was always just one more country over the border, always that little bit further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. 
We were not completely uninterested in culture. But this was a first holiday without parents, as it was for most other Inter-Railers, and in organising our own timetable we left out everything except the most immediately available sights. This was the chance to escape the guided tour, an opportunity to do something different. I took great pride in the fact that, in many places, all I could be bothered to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by, and to have a good time doing so. In this we were no different from most of the other Inter-Railers with whom we shared corridor floors, food and water, money and music. 
The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of somewhere that was previously just a name.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
As a university student, when I entered the university and chose my major, I found a phenomenon that some subjects offered are theoretical, which caused the students' complaints. They think the theoretical courses are not only boring and difficult to learn but also less practical. The present would needs people with practical skills and knowledge to solve the problem in their work. Moreover, when they apply for a job, they stuck in a dilemma situation: they possess the diploma or a degree requested, but they haven't experience or lack adequate practical ability .
We are now entering a brand new era, a completely new stage in its history. The new century is a time of advanced scientific and technological knowledge. As the rapid development of science and technology, there are rapid changes in all aspects of our life, even the value concept. Today is a era quite different from the time when those writers, poets and artists were highly respected. They most desired and hot professions are president of big company, CEO, manager, engineers, doctors, and so on .
So when the students choose their major, their parents also approve them to choose some hot majors, so that they can easily find a decent job, make a comfortable life or even make a fortune .
However, there are also some people agree that superficially some theoretical courses have no practical value, but without the theoretical knowledge, one cannot develop overall. But we should know everyone has limited time and energy, therefore it is impossible and unwise to emphasize too much on some theoretical subjects. We have to face the reality, we should remember a worthy saying: ""the survival of the fittest."" The heavy pressure from the job market forces us to put our limited time and energy into practical courses. If we don't adopt ourselves to the development of our society, we will be eliminated in the fierce competition .
When we were children, our parents often told that if you don't study hard you will be a unuseful person. So they toiled everything to support our life and education. They send us to the school and hope us can get good education and will find a good job in the future. That's their plain dream, but what we will see? A student study three or four years in the university, after graduating he find that it really hard to find a decent job, and the knowledge he acquired in the university is not as useful as they expected. In contrary we may find some people without high degree but they have high practical ability and skills, they really like a duck in the water when they apply for a job. Education aims to arm people with more knowledge so that adds to their competitioners in their future career and enables them to live better. If the education is the university don't follow the development of our society and the courses offered are too theoretical but less practical, we dare say the education just decorate our life but give us nothing .
Things are always changing, with the passage of time, some major are not to be in great demand. We your generation should keep pace with the latest advance of science and technology. Here I'd like to mention another thing - teaching material. Not long ago a friend of mine talked about his university life, he said, in his first class in the university the professor told the students that the subject was not only boring (because it was a theoretical course) but also what they would study was the research result of fifty years ago. He felt very angry and asked the professor a question "" Why should we learn this subject, we come here is to learn the up-to-date knowledge, not such useful rubbish. When I heard this, I felt very sorry. The school administrators have to know what is in need in the labor maket and then decide which courses they should offered to the students. I still remember a passage which said "" We'd not educate children only for the purpose of educating them; our purpose is to fit them for life."" That 's really true .
When I talked here, I think of our education system. It has to improve. Education is key to strength of a country.

"A mountain range is a series of mountains that are connected together generally to form a long line of mountains. Large mountain ranges may be made up of smaller mountain ranges called subranges. 

For example, the Smokey Mountain Range is part of the Appalachian Mountain Range. It is a subrange of the Appalachians. 

The tallest mountain range in the world is the Himalayas and the longest is the Andes. 

The Himalayas stretch 1,491 miles through much of central Asia. They travel from Afghanistan and Pakistan through India, Nepal, and China all the way to Bhutan. The Himalayas also include the formidable Karakoram and Hindu Kush mountain ranges. The Himalayas are most famous for their tall peaks. The majority of the worlds tallest mountains are in the Himalayas including the two tallest mountains: Mount Everest at 29,035 feet and K2 at 28,251 feet. The Himalayas have played an important role in the history of Asia. The mountains in Tibet and the high peaks are considered sacred in many religions including Buddhism and Hinduism. 

At around 4,300 miles long, the Andes Mountains make up the world's longest mountain range. The Andes stretch north to south through much of South America including such countries as Argentina, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela, Colombia, and Ecuador. The highest peak in the Andes is Mount Aconcagua which rises to 22,841 feet. Machu Picchu located high in the Andes. The Andes played a vital role in the history of South America.

Easter quiz for children
During the Easter holidays young visitors can take part in a quiz on the subject ofSurprises.The free quiz sheets can be picked up from the desk at the Orange Street entrance. Children will be directed to 14 surprising paintings and asked a variety of questions about them.
The quiz sheets will be available during normal gallery hours from 25 March until 9 April.
New picture
The Gallery now has a fine still life by the Dutch 18th century painter Jan van Os. This large picture (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is painted in light, bright colours on wood. It is one of the first pictures of this type in the Gallery. The picture is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is not unusual for a picture like this to be dated in two years: the artist waited for particular flowers to bloom in their different seasons in order to paint them. This picture was generously given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister Ida Nancy. It is now on display in Room 25.
Special exhibition
The exhibition 'Painting in Spain during the late 18th century' opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. Recently the Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters of this period. Paret, Melendez and Francisco Bayeu, who are the focus of the exhibition. These three artists are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, by Antonio Gonzalez, and by two Italians who worked in Spain during these years - Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until 31 May.
Lecture news
The series of lectures arranged to go with the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On 5 April, LizzieBarker will discuss the work of Melendez, while on 12 April, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Paret. On 19 and 26 April, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu.
On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often 'tell a story' through their pictures.
Gallery restaurant improvements
The Gallery is delighted to announce that an improved and expanded service is now available in the Gallery restaurant. With its new kitchens the restaurant offers a wide choice of hot and cold dishes at reasonable prices.
Information for visitors
Free guided tours of the Gallery take place every day at 11.00 am and 3.00 pm (except Sundays). These tours introduce some of the Gallery's greatest pictures, and show the whole range of the Gallery's collection of some of the most important European paintings from the 13th to the early 20th centuries.",B1,"{'title': '19.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Gallery News\n\nEaster quiz for children\nDuring the Easter holidays young visitors can take part in a quiz on the subject ofSurprises.The free quiz sheets can be picked up from the desk at the Orange Street entrance.

"The Actor's Craft

Derision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time. Much of this disdain is fuelled by the actors themselves when they're compelled by their film/theatre companies to talk about their craft (and themselves) in interviews. They should give the dancer Pavlova's reply to the man who asked her what she meant when she was dancing: 'If I could tell you,' she said, 'I wouldn't dance it.' But instead they all too easily fall into ponderous cliches, silly truisms or into the prurient jaws of the gossip machine. We should all pay heed to what Paul Scofield said in a letter to a friend of mine: 'I have found that an actor's work has life and interest only in its execution. It seems to wither away in discussion and become emptily theoretical and insubstantial. It has no rules (except perhaps audibility). With every play and every playwright the actor starts from scratch, as if he or she knows nothing and proceeds to learn afresh every time growing with the relationships of the characters and the insights of the writer. When the play has finished its run, he's empty until the next time. And its the emptiness which is, I find, apparent in any discussion of theatre work.'

A review of Hamlet

Adrian Lester's Hamlet is poised precariously between boyhood and manhood, and it is a performance of thrilling simplicity and assurance. His handling of the text and his physical and psychological self-control take him, in one leap, from brilliantly promising to frontline player: an actor with the intelligent confidence to be almost self-effacing. Lester plays an edgy, tetchy young man who feeds on a banked-down sense of anger, agile, watchful and driven, he deploys a sense of acid wit and generous humour that makes him both formidable and lovable. Although played down, the virtuosity of this performance is unmistakable. Observe Lester's body, the way his arms hang stiffly, giving you a sense of a figure waiting to be animated. Handy's portrayal of Horatio gives you a similar feeling of a body being moved by an inner force that he both knows and does not know. So what is acting? What is behaviour? Is the former an imitation or an evocation of the latter? Who and what animates these bodies, morally and physically? That is the central question about the life of the theatre.

One director's approach to rehearsal

The first stage of this director's rehearsal process is known as 'dropping in', a procedure which goes something like this. The stage manager projects the script onto a screen. The actors sit quietly while someone else is speaking, finding out what effect the words are having. When if is their turn to speak, they glance of the screen, digest the first phrase, think about what it means to them, wait to find the impulse - the reason to speak - then speak. For example, the line is, 'Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?; Breathe. Let the thought drop in with your breath. A memory, a vision, an impression. Some people will imagine a queue, maybe at a bus stop on the way to rehearsals or for a rock concert in their youth. Having visualised the scene, find the impulse to speak it - what this director calls 'The pathway to the line'. Impulses can come from without or within. Look in the eyes of the other actor listening. Consider your character's situation. This director talks of 'dropping in' as a means of finding out what is going on. Don't pre-plan or pre-judge. Dare to go down there with an empty mind and trust that something will happen to you.

The Perfect Theatre

The perfect theatre should make you feel as if your presence has made a difference. Going to the theatre, going to any live performance, is an event and the staff need to have a sense of that, too. It's terribly alienating if you feel that its just any old job for the people working front of house.
The theatre itself needs to create a relationship between the performer and the audience - no one in the audience should feel that they're getting an unreasonably prejudiced view of the actor. It's important that they're not too far away, they can hear, they can see, they can feel in some sense in contact with what's going on on stage. The proportions of an auditorium are important. They have to respond to the human voice and the scale of the human body. If an auditorium dwarfs the human body, there's something wrong with it because you can't deny the human form at the heart of drama. A lot of theatres in the late nineteenth century got it right because they managed to shape an auditorium that somehow embraces the stage.
I like theatres that have a sense of the past in them. Like worn stone steps in a church, you get the sense of layers of human presence. From the point of view of the plays, you can't have something for everybody. You cant second-guess an audience because they don't know what they're going to want to see. When you visit the theatre, you want something done in a way you can't imagine, otherwise you may as well have stayed at home.",C2,"{'title': '58.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""The Actor's Craft\n\nDerision and contempt are sprayed at actors from time to time.

"It’s true - we’re all getting too big for our boots

Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy when he left school. 'What do you want to be?' asked the teacher. 'The flagpole on a ship?' The teacher had a point - because Chris, though still only fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man.
Every decade, the average height of people in Europe grows another centimetre. Every year, more and more truly big people are born. Intriguingly, this does not mean humanity is producing a new super race. In fact, we are returning to what we were like as cavemen. Only now are we losing the effects of generations of poor diet - with dramatic effects. 'We are only now beginning to fulfil our proper potential,' says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. 'We are becoming Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.'
For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from a wide variety of sources: women gathered herbs, fruits and berries, while men supplemented these with occasional kills of animals (a way of life still adopted by the world's few remaining tribes of hunter- gatherers). One research study found that they based their diet on 85 different wild plants, for example. Then about 9,000 years ago, agriculture was invented - with devastating consequences. Most of the planet's green places have been gradually taken over by farmers, with the result that just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice and maize - provide more than half of the calories consumed by the human race today.
This poor diet has had a disastrous effect on human health and physique. Over the centuries we have lived on soups, porridges and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists discovered that when they began to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers were turned into sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay increased, as did diseases. Far from being one of the blessings of the New World, corn was a public health disaster, according to some anthropologists.
Nevertheless, from then on agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times the number of people who had previously lived off it as hunter-gatherers. The fact that most people relying on this system are poorly nourished and stunted has only recently been tackled, even by the world's wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US and Japan are diets again reflecting the richness of our ancestors' diets.
As a result, the average man in the US is now 179cm, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. It is a welcome trend, though not without its own problems. Heights may have risen, but the world has not moved on, it seems. A standard bed-length has remained at 190cm since 1860. Even worse, leg-room in planes and trains seems to have shrunk rather than grown, while clothes manufacturers are constantly having to revise their range of products.
The question is: where will it all end? We cannot grow for ever. We must have some programmed upper limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel, of University, it could be as much as 193 cm - and we are likely to reach it some time this century.
However, scientists add one note of qualification. Individuals may be growing taller because of improved nutrition, but as a species we are actually shrinking. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, members of the human race were slightly rounder and taller - an evolutionary response to the cold. (Large, round bodies are best at keeping in heat.) Since the climate warmed, we appear to have got slightly thinner and smaller, even when properly fed. And as the planet continues to heat up, we may shrink even further.

"Life was getting out of hand

Susan Harr unplugs her gadgets and rediscovers the joys of manual labour.

Everyone is in love with technology. It gives us all those marvellous gadgets that make life easier and leave us so much more time to do other things. A gradual, though not particularly subtle, form of brainwashing has persuaded us that technology rules, and that it is OK.
These implications are obvious. The movement of my fingers uses nothing from the previous power supply being eaten up by our greedy race. A craft executed by hand does not pollute the environment.
However, a recent unhappy experience with my malfunctioning word processor -
a £48 call-out fee, a labour charge of £15 per quarter of an hour, plus parts and replacements costs - has confirmed a suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the expense or the trouble. Are we as dependent on technology as we imagine? Bit by bit, I have been letting the household technology fall by the wayside as its natural and often short life expires.
This makes me wonder just what 'time' technology gives us. The time to take up more activities for which we must buy more gadgets? If so, hats off to the marketing experts: but I think they are conning us.
So when the thing started making curious noises, which continued even when it was disconnected by a puzzled service agent, I abandoned it to the backyard, where it whispers damply to itself like some robot ghost.
I am not tied to a noisy, whirring machine, with my head bent and my back turned on the world, and I can take my time over the garment. In any case, I was always slightly alarmed by those electric machines that dash across the fabric towards your fingers. Best of all, I can pop the whole lot into a carrier bag and take it with me wherever I go.
Of course, there are some gadgets I would not like to be without. A year living without a washing machine convinced me of the value of the electric washtub. But there are others whose loss has brought unexpected delight. Feeling that we were becoming too apt to collapse in front of the television, or slot in a video, I sent back the rented colour equipment and we returned to the small black-and-white portable.
It is a real strain on the eyes and concentrates the mind on what is really worth watching. We now spend a lot more time walking the dog (who never liked television anyway), reading, talking or pursuing other hobbies.
One of these, in my own case, is sewing; and here is another gadget that went by the board. My old Singer sewing machine is now an ornamental plant table, and as l cannot afford to replace it, I have taken to sewing by hand.
We have come to believe that we could not do without it, and if we do resist the notion that our lives would be unmanageable without the appliances of science we certainly do not want to relinquish them. Pity the generations whose lives were blighted by tedious and blister inducing toil. Even our brains are relieved of exertion by computers that not only perform miraculous calculations with amazing speed but now provide entertainment.
In fact, the time I now spend placidly stitching is anything but tedious, and the advantages are numerous. For a start, I can sew and listen to the radio - another rediscovered pleasure - or I can talk with family and friends. If it is a simple task, I can watch the programmes I do want to see on television, and alleviate my puritanical guilt at sitting in front of the box by doing something useful at the same time. And what a lovely, cosy feeling it is to sit by the fire and sew with a pot of tea for company.
Quite wrongly, I had tended to think with horror of the women who sewed elaborate garments, robes, linen and household items by hand. I thought of those long hours, the strain on the eyes and so on. 
There is a wonderfully soothing quality about executing a craft by hand, a great satisfaction in watching one's work become neater, more assured. I find things get done surprisingly quickly, and the pace of life suddenly slows down to the rhythm of my own hands.

Meanwhile I have regained control of my sink, where I plunge my hands into the suds and daydream while doing the washing up agreeable, if temporarily forgotten, activity.
The result of all this brooding is that I now prowl the house with a speculative eye. Do we really need the freezer, the microwave oven, that powered lawnmower?

It gives us all those marvellous gadgets that make life easier and leave us so much more time to do other things. A gradual, though not particularly subtle, form of brainwashing has persuaded us that technology rules, and that it is OK.\nThese implications are obvious. The movement of my fingers uses nothing from the previous power supply being eaten up by our greedy race. A craft executed by hand does not pollute the environment.\nHowever, a recent unhappy experience with my malfunctioning word processor -\na £48 call-out fee, a labour charge of £15 per quarter of an hour, plus parts and replacements costs - has confirmed a suspicion that gadgets are often not worth the expense or the trouble. Are we as dependent on technology as we imagine? Bit by bit, I have been letting the household technology fall by the wayside as its natural and often short life expires.\nThis makes me wonder just what 'time' technology gives us. The time to take up more activities for which we must buy more gadgets? If so, hats off to the marketing experts: but I think they are conning us.\nSo when the thing started making curious noises, which continued even when it was disconnected by a puzzled service agent, I abandoned it to the backyard, where it whispers damply to itself like some robot ghost.\nI am not tied to a noisy, whirring machine, with my head bent and my back turned on the world, and I can take my time over the garment. In any case, I was always slightly alarmed by those electric machines that dash across the fabric towards your fingers. Best of all, I can pop the whole lot into a carrier bag and take it with me wherever I go.\nOf course, there are some gadgets I would not like to be without. A year living without a washing machine convinced me of the value of the electric washtub. But there are others whose loss has brought unexpected delight.

Thank you for your letter. I had my first day at my new school today. A girl called Nicole looked after me and showed me where the classrooms were. She is very nice and I am going to visit her this weekend.
My favourite lesson today was Maths and I was happy because I knew more than the other girls. I also played hockey for the first time. I really enjoyed it. 
Most of the teachers seem friendly but I’m afraid of the head teacher. No one likes him because he shouts a lot. 
I must go now because I have to do my homework.

"Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money is an important part of our life. Human beeing stands on the existence of money. Everyone needs money to satisfy his own necessity. Money produces evil among all people in spite of proverb: ""All is not gold that glitters."" Same people have the only aim - to get money no matter how .
Money determines social position in society. High class is represented mostly by businessmen or employees of American firms. American firms offer to their employees high wages but they must submit everything to their job. Their families and children have nearly everything they want but they lose their fathers and their family life is missing. At that time children are influenced by their friends very much. So there is a dangerous of gambling, alcohol, drugs etc .
Gambling is important problem among young people. Gamblers need a lot of money to play games. They are dependent on the games in a while. They spend all their money and still need them. They are able to do everything to gain money for the games. Children often steal money at home. Dependance on gambling is something like dependance on drugs so gamblers are also treated in medical institutions .
Crime is connected mostly with money. Thefts, robberies, murders are realized especially because of money . ""Appetite comes with eating"" so crime is spread more and more because some people wants still more and more money. They are able to risk possibility to get in prison but their yearn for money is stronger. For example gangs, which are interested in stealing cars, have been increasing. We can ask why? The answer is that they have a large sum of money from this. It is unbelievable that someone can exchange a part of his life in prison for money. Even if they do not hesitate to use violence or murder anyone only for money .
Everyone is used to live in his living standart. Importance of having money we feel especially when we have not them enought. In this case we started to think up how money gets. People imagine that money can fulfill all their dreams. Actually it is truee but not at all. When you have a large amount of money you can buy everything, but you can not buy true friends, health, love of your wife, your husband or your children. By public opinion research in Czech republic, where people were asked to their value of life, we have known interesting things. In these years people's opinions have been changed. Importance of possessive has increased and overtook importance of education and hobbies. Result from this research is unpleasant not only for me. The people are not interested in education or hobbies but mostly in money. It never mind what a man does but the main thing is how much money he earns .
All people need money, it is natural. But important is how much they are able to sacrifice for money. Children suffer from their parents' work because they are all time in their job. Children having enough money can start with gambling. Then they need money more and more so they are able to commit a crime. People's oppinions have been changed in consequence of reaching money.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
There is no doubt that most university degrees are theoretical. They do not prepare students for the real world and are therefore of very little value. Students that graduate have studied for many years, but they have never tried out their theories in the real world. Everybody can read a book on mathematics or biology, but do they learn how to use it in their future profession? Nobody can argue that there is a great difference from reading about something and do it for real. It is sad when one after five or six years of studying find out that one do not fit in the profession one was aiming at. It goes without saying that an education is an expensive investment in one's future. If one is unfortunate enough one have to start all over again to get a new education that fits. This could have been discovered much earlier .
A great many student with university degrees become teachers. During their studies they do not have the opportunity to find out if they fit as teacher. They do their reading, but they do not know what is the most important to learn or how they can teach it to their future pupils. If they had a chance to do it practically in their studies they would know more about teaching. One need exercise to become a skilful teacher .
It is obvious that some people are better theoretical than practical and vice versa. Some students may get the best marks in the university, but they do not know how to do a day's work. On the contrary there are students who are good at practical work, but not at theoretical studies that are found in the university. Is it fair that those who get a degree with excellent marks should get the jobs that the latter could have done better? I guess there are a good many employers that would choose those who know how to work in the real world, and do not only have the knowledge of different theories. I personally hope so. At secondary school most of the teachers have graduated from a university. They know a good deal about their own subject, but do not know how to teach it to their pupils. What is the use of such teachers? One has to think about those who suffer damage namely the pupils .
In spite of the examples above, quite a few people argue that university degrees are valuable. Even though some students do not manage to relate their studies to the real world, a great many of them do. A number of people also claim that one have to know the theory before one gets a job. Theory forms the basis of good work. That may be true, but why do they not include practical work in the degrees like they do in for example training colleges? Then there would be both the theoretical aspect and the practical aspect. But that is not how the university functions. People at the university have attached importance to the theoretical aspect for many years now and will doubtfully change that in the next couple of years. It has always been like that. Maybe the system would be changed if there were granted more money. Until then we will have to deal with the theoretical degrees and hope that the students manage to relate their studies to the real world .
As we have seen there is a disagreement between those who believe that the university degrees are of little value and those who think that they are valuable. Still nobody knows what the future will bring.

"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS 

How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects, the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school - especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity. Such children - as well as those whose ability is actively encouraged by parents or teachers - may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. 
The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction. They aim to provide a sympathetic environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians.
Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities, for example, individual lessons (up to three hours a week on first and second instruments), orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is taken up with a restricted academic programme, which tends to concentrate on the essential subjects - English, maths, basic sciences and languages - although provision can be made for students who wish to study a wider range of subjects. All five British specialist schools are independent, classes are small by normal school standards, with a high teacher/pupil ratio. Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders, leaving home to live, eat and sleep full-time at school. This means they spend their formative years in the company of others with similar aims and interests. 
What are the disadvantages? An obvious problem is the cost; the fees are high (£12,000-£17,000 a year for boarders). However, each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance, to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, specially at a very early age. Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such an intense and disciplined environment. They stress, however, that their main aim is to turn out 'rounded and well-balanced individuals'. 
There is little doubt that setting musically gifted children apart from an early age can cause stress. Early signs of musical ability may disappear in teenage years, while natural competitiveness and the pressure to succeed can lead to a crushing sense of failure. But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils, and offer help and advice if needed. In addition, while most former pupils at music school feel that they benefited enormously from the range of high-quality music teaching available, many express reservations about the wisdom of restricting the academic programme, which definitely takes second place to musical activities. Many musically gifted young people are also highly intelligent, well able to deal with academic pressure, and feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met. For these reasons, it may be better to wait until the child is old enough to be able to make his or her own decisions before considering a specialist education. 
Those who are equally gifted academically may do very well within a less specialised environment; for instance, at a school with a first class music department, or else by combining a normal school routine with musical training at one of the junior departments at the music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning opportunities for individual lessons with fine teachers, plus orchestral and chamber music experience. But this option is clearly not practicable for families living out of reach of London or other major centres.",B2,"{'title': '9ee1ed33-e79d-4477-84f7-fe9d4dcc37c7.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS \n\nHow to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability?

"Vancouver

In the last ten years or so, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken up residence in Vancouver, in western Canada. To relax in the evening, residents stroll down the city streets and, if you join them, you are likely to overhear a different language at almost every other step. People come to Vancouver for its mild climate, its wonderful setting between the ocean and the mountains, its clean and safe environment and its educational and job opportunities. And much as some may grumble about the speed at which new buildings have sprung up, there's no doubt that the new arrivals and flourishing tourism industry have helped fuel an urban renaissance. Locals once referred to Vancouver as 'Terminal City' because of the city's role as a terminus or gateway to all other places. Though the name has fallen slightly out of favour, Vancouver is more a gateway than ever.

Putting Pen to Paper

Journalists like myself are usually poor letter-writers. I have heard it said that this is because of the instinctive distaste we feel at writing something we are not going to be paid for, but I cannot believe we have quite such mercenary characters. It is more probably that since in our work, we are always striving to get the greatest possible effect, the essential spontaneity of a letter escapes us. The real creative artist, who does not consciously work on the effect at all (though he may rewrite a passage dozens of times), does not have this problem. I believe that it is in this inherent grasp of the effect of his words that there lies the only sure test of the real artist. When Shakespeare wrote some of his famous lines he surely never thought consciously that it was the contrast between polysyllables that made them so effective, as well as showing him to be a great writer.

Supermarket Opening

The opening of a new supermarket used to be a bit of an event in Britain. You could always rely on a soap star, a disc jockey or a minor member of the royal family to come down and cut the ribbon. Now it seems that new branches are popping up every day in many areas and so the poor old celebrity has become superfluous. Why pay a famous person when any Tom, Dick or Harry will open it for nothing? Last week, waiting pensioners didn't care who opened the new branch of Superbuy, so long as they were at the front. According to one prospective customer who knew someone who worked there, the first five men over the threshold would be getting a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women, a bunch of flowers. This snippet of information quickly swept through the crowd, instilling feelings of smug superiority among those at the front, and envy from the latecomers.",C2,"{'title': '1.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Vancouver\n\nIn the last ten years or so, hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world have taken up residence in Vancouver, in western Canada.

"Title: Do you think that the death penalty should be abolished? 
 
Nowadays we should be civilized enough to be able to find other forms of penalty regardless of the severeness of a crime. There are nations where death penalty is still legalized and applied. But we must ask ourselves whether it really affects the crime rate! Does it reduce criminality? Experience has shown that the crime rate in countries where death penalty is rejected as a legal form of punishment is not higher compared with those of countries where it is legally accepted .
That fact proves that criminals are not prevented from criminal actions because of the existence of death penalty. That is why we must ask ourselves whether there exist other mesures of punishment which are more effective, mesures which have a deterrent effect, acting as exemplary punishments. We know that death penalty has not been able to meet this requirement. When I write this I do not think about physical mesures of even about torture. But in my opinion being arrested for a long period of time or for the rest of the life can be the severest form of punishment for human beings. Being forced to work hard in jail without seeing any results or receiving any feedback for the work seems to me to be much more effective. Many criminals would prefer death to jail. I believe that it is worst for a human being not to have the freedom to go where one wants to and what one wishes to do. For criminals it might be easier to die than to be forced to live in imprisonment. Some even decide to commit suicide instead of being put in prison .
To decide about the life of a criminal, who still remains a human being, seems to e a little like playing god. The lifes of judges in nations where death penalty is still legalized and of those people who have to carry out the ""killing"" of criminals are also destroyed in some way. I can not imagine that this can be seen as a normal job. One can not go home in the evening and forget about the ""work"" during the day. It must be an enormous burden for everybody however hardened one is .
I have never been in the situation of a victim in such a severe case and I have not been concerned either. Although I am against all forms of violence I try to understand the feelings of affected people. I can imagine they wish to do harm to the culprit who has hurtened them, their relatives or their friends. It is just human and I am sure that I would react in a similar way. To supress the hate must be nearly impossible But we would not be better in any account, would we? From the view of affected persons death penalty might be seen as justified, for example, for murder, for abusing children or for doing harm to any other innocent person. But it does not really help the victims, does it? Maybe for a short moment there is a feeling of retaliation. But in order to cope with the situation it will take a long time and help in other forms than revenge will be required .

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
I am a third class student in ELT department and when I ask my self about the quality of the education that I have been taking , I realize that it is mostly full of theoretical information and university education does not prepare me for real conditions. In an other word university education does not provide me with the necessary experiences for teaching satisfactorily in the future. This situation decreases the value and importance of university education in my mind. So in some aspects I agree with the idea that most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for real world. They are there for of little value. The main reason for thinking so is poorly designed lesson plans of universities .
The chief reason decreasing the value of university education is insufficient lesson plans. I think being a good teacher has some important components such as knowing your subject very well , knowing how to teach it to the students , being able to sympathize with students , being able solve different problems etc . . . Sometimes I ask that how many of these features we will have when we graduate from the university as English teachers. As first I think of our subject , namely English. It could be possible to accept that at university we learn English in a sufficient way. In an other word we have the first feature , adequate knowledge of our subject , of a good teacher. But when we ask about the other components of the ideal teacher it impossible to say that we gain those features during our university education , because lessons such as teaching methods and education psychology taught at universities are designed in a poor way , and so these lessons can not go further than providing 
students with theoretical information. They are just theoretical because , these classes are designed just for the ideal situation , for situation that is supposed to be , but not for the real situation .
For example; in method classes we are taught a set of teaching method. We study what these methods aim , what kind of activities they consist of , but we do not cover what kind of problems we will have while using these methods. Moreover we do not have the practicing these methods in real situations. In order to practice these methods we have some micro teaching experiences. But these micro sessions are so far from real conditions that we get nearly any profit of them. In this sessions our objects are our classmates so the level is very high and we do not have any problem while experiencing the methods. Every thing goes in a perfect way so we are not able to learn what kind problems we will face while using these methods , what kind of questions we will be asked , in which part of the subject students will have difficulty to understand etc . . . . Since we do not have any problem in micro sessions , we do not know what to do when students come up with an unexpected question , how to answer it. When I start to teach in a school and when I face many unpredictable questions , reactions etc . . , since at the university I am not prepared such kind of situations we will have to produce our own method and we will keep the methods that we study at university just as inadequate information .
An other example of poorly designed lessons is education psychology classes. These classes aim to teach us sympathizing with our students , understanding their psychology, feeling etc . . . In these classes the general image of our object , namely the image of our students is thought as the perfect children who are eager to learn whatever we telling. But in real situation we will deal with many different personalities and it certain that all of them won't be wonderful children. We will have problems with our students and we are not given any advice about what we should do when one of our students breaks the concentration of whole class in an unacceptable way or how we should react when a student reject to listen to the lesson , etc . . . Shortly education psychology classes just provides us with insufficient information 
As conclusion I can say that as a result of poorly designed lesson plans of universities , we will graduate from university as insufficient English teachers. When we face a problem with our students , our inadequate method an psychology classes won't be able to help us and at this point we will try to remember what our primary or secondary school teachers used to do to solve problems or to teach a subject etc . . .

"Little Chefs

For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course.

"Simon Costello knew that the purchase of the house in Pembroke Square had been a mistake within a year of his and Lois's moving in. A possession which can only be afforded by the exercise of stringent and calculated economy is best not afforded at all. But at the time it had seemed a sensible, as well as a desirable, move. He had had a run of successful cases and they were coming in with reassuring regularity. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency within two months of the birth of the twins, and had been given a rise which took her salary to thirty-five thousand. It was Lois who had argued the more strongly for a move, but he had put up little resistance to arguments which at the time had seemed compelling: the flat wasn't really suitable for a family, they needed more room, a garden, separate accommodation for an au pair. All these, of course, could have been achieved in a suburb or in a less fashionable part of London than Pembroke Square, but Lois was ambitious for more than additional space. Mornington Mansions had never been an acceptable address for an up-and-coming young barrister and a successful businesswoman. She never said it without a sense that even speaking the words subtly diminished her standing, socially and economically.
Lois had decided that a necessary economy was for one of them to travel by public transport. Her firm was on the other side of London; obviously Simon must be the one to economise. The overcrowded tube journey, stayed in a mood of envious resentment, had become an unproductive thirty minutes of brooding on present discontents. He would recall his grandfather's house in Hampstead where he had stayed as a boy, the smell of dinner from the kitchen, his grandmother's insistence that the returning breadwinner, tired from his exhausting day in court, should be given peace, a little gentle cosseting, and relief from every petty domestic anxiety. She had been a 'lawyer's wife', indefatigable in legal good causes, elegantly present at all lawyers' functions, apparently content with the sphere of life which she had made her own. Well, that world had passed for ever. Lois had made it plain before their marriage that her career was as important as his. It hardly needed saying, this was, after all, a modern marriage. The job was important to her and important to them both. The house, the au pair, their whole standard of living depended on two salaries. And now what they were precariously achieving could be destroyed by that self-righteous, interfering Venetia.
Venetia must have come straight from the court to their offices and she had been in a dangerous mood. Something or someone had upset her. But the word 'upset' was too weak, too bland for the intensity of furious disgust with which she had confronted him. Someone had driven her to the limit of her endurance. He cursed himself. If he hadn't been in his room, if he'd only left a minute earlier, the encounter wouldn't have taken place, she would have had the night to think it over, to consider what, if anything, she ought to do. Probably nothing. The morning might have brought sense. He remembered every word of her angry accusations.
'I defended Brian Cartwright today. Successfully. He told me that when you were his counsel four years ago you knew before trial that he had bribed three of the jury. You did nothing. You went on with the case. Is that true?'
'He's lying. It isn't true.'
'He also said that he passed over some shares in his company to your fiancee. Also before trial. Is that true?'
'I tell you, he's lying. None of its true.'
The denial had been as instinctive as an arm raised to ward off a blow and had sounded unconvincing even to his own ears. His whole action had been one of guilt. The first cold horror draining his face was succeeded by a hot flush, bringing back shameful memories of his headmaster's study, of the terror of the inevitable punishment. He had made himself look into her eyes and had seen the look of contemptuous disbelief. If only he'd had some warning. He knew now what he should have said: 'Cartwright told me after the trial but I didn't believe him. I don't believe him now. That man will say anything to make himself important.'
But he had told a more direct, more dangerous lie, and she had known that it was a lie. Even so, why the anger, why the disgust? What was that old misdemeanour to do with her? Who had sent Venetia Aldridge to be guardian of the conscience of their legal practice? Or of his, come to that? Was her own conscience so clear, her behaviour in court always immaculate? Was she justified in destroying his career? And it would be destruction.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
The latest years it has become very difficult to find a job. It is often even moredifficult to find a job if you have a university degree than if you have a lower one. Is this because most university degrees are theoretical and therefore do not prepare students enough for the real world?
It is true that people who are for example a plumber or a technician do not need a university diploma and they can often find a job after they have finished their secondary school. These people are indeed trained to practise a certain profession and most of the time they have to do a work placement during their training .
People who have a university degree, on the other hand, have almost or no practise during their education, the only thing they have are a lot of books or courses they have to know by heart. Unfortunately, students at a university also do not do a work placement in their last year .
I think it is a pity that most university education do not have a work placement for their students in their last year, but if that really is not possible, I think the students themselves shoud have to prepare for the real world. There are several ways to do so .
In the first place, the students can prepare by acquiring knowledge about all kinds of things. During their student days, they should read a lot of books, newspapers and magazines. That way they learn a lot about politics, economics, culture and so on. The school can not learn you all these things, but you need to have a general knowledge if you want to become a part of the real world .
Secondly, the students should insert a work placement themselves. They can, for example, go studying at a university in another country for one year, take a course abroad for a month during the holidays or do a holiday job in a company. By doing a holiday job they learn what real life is all about, they get to know life in a company and moreover they earn some money .
In the third place, I think that students should not only learn their books and courses by heart because they have to know the material for the exams, but they should really try to see the importance of all the things they learn for later life. Unfortunately, some students keep studying only for the exams and do not see the importance of a general knowledge .
To conclude, I agree that university degrees are too theoretical and therefore they do not prepare students enough for the real world. But university degrees are not at all of little value if the students themselves complement their studies with some general knowledge, a course abroad or a vacation job. Besides, in my opinion, one of the characteristics of a university degree is that the people who have it are independent people, who are, with or without a lot of practical training, very ready for the real world .",B2,"{'title': '082_DBAN1017.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
	From 19th century feminism is becoming more and more popular as a tool for women to be freedom and equal on every aspect. We all know that women had very little rights and their social status was also lower than men before. So many feminists or organizations for women appeared to help women to get rights and improve their social status. However, nowadays there are more about whether feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good or not. Some people hold on their opinions that feminists have done more good to the cause of women than bad because feminists work for women and have achieved succeed in some aspects. However, I think feminists have done more to the cause of women than good because they receive much stress than before on several aspects .
	First of all, on the aspect family, feminists have help women improve their status, but they feel stressful with their families. With the encourage of feminists women can go out from their home to get a job, and they get rid of the household jobs. However, problems also occur followed with freedom. They begin to busy with their jobs and have no or little time to accompany with their children and husbands. They want to show themselves they are also very outstanding as men so they should work much harder than men. Their children begin rely on their fathers and women will feel lonely because their jobs estrange them from families. Furthermore, they can not stay at home everyday to enjoy life no longer because have to work. Women feel much stressful with their families .
	Secondly, on the aspect of politics, women get much more right than before which means that they also receive stress from it. Even though women's political status is improved, they should also do much things for politics or society. Many women devote themselves to politics, for example, they want to work at political office and are active at winning one election. There was no worries for women about how to win one election and how to use their rights correctly before, but now they have to worry about these things because feminists have made them own such rights. Furthermore, if they can not use their rights correctly their people will endure much painess. For such reasons women are more stressful than before .
	Finally, women are very stressful on the aspect of family economy. Feminists have have women to be equal in their families so that they should also work to earn half of their family spend as men do. We all know that women and men have much difference in physical aspect,. But now women should do the same things as men, so women will feel stressful. However, before feminists work for women to get rights and to be equal with men, there is no necessary for women to worry about how to earn money for their families and work out everyday. For this family economy women are stressful .

"Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
A new regulation is being enforced concerning advertisement on cigarettes. Police are more and more hard towards alcohol abuse, especially while driving. Customs officers and the anti-drug brigade are constantly developping new techniques to detect drug traffic, and dealers are punished with life imprisonment. However the authorities seem to ignore completely another important factor people are slaves to: television. Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace it with television .
We would like to demonstrate that television lost its didactive role a long time ago. It has now become a sure means for the great men of our society to force people into doing exactly what they are expected to do. What is very disturbing is that the influence of television seems to make itself felt in all generations: children, adolescents as well as adults .
Let's first consider the children. Just back from school, they rush into the armchair in front of the tvset. They would not miss that famous animated cartoon where the hero can kill anyone who upsets him! The time of the sweet and beautiful princesses is over. They have been replaced by strong warriors with the most modern weapons. For his birthday, the child absolutely wants his own ""Ninja Turtle"", the one you see on television. He will grow up with the preestablished ideas that society wants him to have. Children are being manipulated by images which make them long for monster-toys. They are the innocent victims of our materialistic world which has left no place for individual freedom .
No wonder that a child like that can not get rid of these ideas when he reaches the adolescence. More than ever, the teenager wants to assert himself in life. But, being confronted with all kinds of new events such as love, responsabilities or just physical changes, he does not know how to do it. Therefore he will conform to the stereotypes proposed by television. He will listen to the latest hits, drink Coca-Cola, wear those new clothes and so obey the rules of the great men of society .
We will finally deal with the generation of adults. The housewife only buys the washing-powder shown on television .
Her husband looks at the news. He only sees one side of the picture but he does not realize it. The journalists ' speech is convincing enough for him to believe this is the only truth. All this forces us into thinking that people are becoming addicted to television .
We have proved that television has become one of the major factors which influence our everyday life on all levels .
It has destruted our own personality and our family life. It has replaced our own opinions and indicted us with stereotypes ideas. The world has become a slave to the tvset: we do and think exactly what it wants. Some people may find it exaggerated. They may not agree on this association between television and opium. Those people should try to turn off their television for just one week. They would then have time for walking or telling their children about the old fairy tales... but they will surely not stand it very long: she will want to see the following of her favourite serial, he will not miss the live football match.

"POETRY RECITALS

At any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it, and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view. It is fairly safe to say that, at the present time, there is an especially bewildering complexity of poetic tendencies, of kinds of poetry being written, of warring factions, of ways of presenting, criticising and teaching poetry, and of conflicting beliefs about the role of the poet in society. 
Very broadly speaking, the present debate in contemporary poetry concerns the reciprocal mistrust and disapproval shown by the seriously committed 'literary' writers, whose poems are intended to be printed and read on the page, and the 'popular', performing poets who, while they will probably publish their verses in magazines and collections, are happier declaiming them to an audience. Of course, this division is far from absolute.
The practice of promoting public poetry readings has been steadily increasing over the past twenty years or so, in many different forms. Small literary societies in provincial towns conduct them in village halls or the sitting rooms of their members; schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to audiences of students; arts festivals often advertise poetry readings by well-known authors on their programmes. The consequences of all these events, and of poets being more or less obliged to become public performers, are manifold and of uncertain benefit to them as mists.
For the 'pop' poets, whose work has been composed expressly for the purpose of recital to live audiences, the issue is plain. They can only profit from public performance. Their verses are often very simple in both form and content, and can be assimilated at a single hearing; it is on the printed page that the deficiencies of thought, technique and imagination become clear. Poets who are dedicated to their craft, and are doing their best to continue and develop what is finest in the traditions of poetry - which involves compressing the maximum amount of passion, thought, wit and vision into the smallest possible space and achieving rhythmic effects of great variety and subtlety -- are unlikely to be appreciated by an audience which is probably encountering their work for the first time. The danger here is, not that they will be tempted to emulate the content and style of the entertainers, but that they might, in the effort to achieve instant communication, read only their most readily accessible work which is quite likely to be their slightest and least characteristic. 
Attendance at poetry reading cannot be a substitute for reading poetry on the page, though it can be an enjoyable and instructive adjunct. To hear good poets read their work aloud, even if they are not accomplished public speakers, is a valuable guide as to where the precise emphases are to be placed, but it is desirable that the audience should either follow the reading with the text before them or have a prior knowledge of the poems being spoken. The principal justification for popular recitals of poetry, where the readings are sometimes interspersed with musical items (jazz and poetry used to be a very popular mixture), is that audiences will come to associate poetry with pleasure and not feel that it is an art available only to an initiated minority.",C2,"{'title': '4.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""POETRY RECITALS\n\nAt any given time in history the literary scene will seem confused to those who are living through it, and it is the selectivity of posterity that makes the pattern and orders of eminence appear clearly defined to the retrospective view.

"HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON

American executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a rough idea of what he did. America, however, has only just discovered him - although the Wall Street Journal's description of Shackleton earlier this year as 'an Antarctic explorer whose beats went all but unnoticed for most of the 20th century' is taking things too far. But now the Americans are making up for lost time with powerful enthusiasm. Biographies and accounts of the voyage of the Endurance are in production and are expected to spring off the shells as fast as they are stacked; the American Museum of Natural History is mounting a grand exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is preparing a film based on Shackleton's life.
Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as icon and exemplar. His sell-appointed apostles recount the details of his deeds with awe; they extract lessons in leadership and communications as parables for spin doctors, and insiders refer to each other as 'speaking Shackleton'. The determined, resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag (fur inside) and blubber-stove has become a model for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, took Shackleton for a role model years ago. His firm specialises in ‘communication aspects of mergers and acquisitions and corporate crises’. Such as? Such as ‘this firm's plant blew up’ or 'half the workforce has to go'. While not forgetting that Shackleton served time in public relations for a Glasgow steel works, it may be a trifle difficult to spot instantly the relevance of eking out the last bit of albatross in sub-zero temperatures to putting a spin on a derivatives trading disaster for the Internet.
‘Even if a company manages its crises beautifully, it can still do a lot of harm by communicating sadly about what it's doing,' says MacGregor. 'Shackleton is a model for management because of his qualities as a leader and communicator. He had his values in order. he was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a great deal to lose — such as their lives. In some ways the most fascinating decision Shackleton made was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That trip explained his credibility for the next one: the lives of his men were paramount.' This refers to Shackleton's expedition to reach the South Pole in 1908 when, 97 miles short of their objective, with unforeseen delays draining their supplies and limited time to get back to their ship, Shackleton made the courageous and difficult decision to turn hack.
In a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. Whereas now the tendency is for managers to duck and squirm, Shackleton was prepared to stand up and accept responsibility. His 1914 expedition was the one that became the stuff of legend. His ship, the Endurance, drifted for nine months in the pack ice and was finally crushed by ice floes. When it finally went down, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety provided that you continue to do your utmost and to trust me'. From all the accounts and diaries the then kept, it is clear that there was never a time that the Boss was not in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every eventuality, kept his men continually informed and sought their opinions,' says MacGregor. ‘He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start afresh. We've built an effective set of principles here that Shackleton illustrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling thry’re being criticised.'
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance and patience. ‘One of the hardest things to do in desperate straits is notating, especially in America, a culture that is fanatically opposed to letting time sort things out,’ says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on the interest rates, you hang in there and eventually you’ll get your money back. To “fix it” and sell up would mean a huge loss. Equally, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product's a stinker, don't keep selling it.’
Shackleton led by example. On the voyage back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, gloveless. He forced his own on Hurley, saying if he didn't put them on he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same thing with a biscuit when they were near starving on the 1905 expeditions: ‘He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public appetite for heroic endeavour is increasing. Shackleton exposes the fact that there is nothing heroic going on now. Everything else falls away and he is left standing, the genuine embodiment of the ideals that we are so wistful for nowadays.'",C2,"{'title': 'b2f9f62a-9544-45cc-87e7-2d57400115dd.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON\n\nAmerican executives are adopting the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model of good management.

He had his values in order. he was at his best when he and those dependent on him had a great deal to lose — such as their lives. In some ways the most fascinating decision Shackleton made was to turn back when only 97 miles from the South Pole. That trip explained his credibility for the next one: the lives of his men were paramount.' This refers to Shackleton's expedition to reach the South Pole in 1908 when, 97 miles short of their objective, with unforeseen delays draining their supplies and limited time to get back to their ship, Shackleton made the courageous and difficult decision to turn hack.\nIn a crisis, says MacGregor, people want to know someone is in charge. Whereas now the tendency is for managers to duck and squirm, Shackleton was prepared to stand up and accept responsibility. His 1914 expedition was the one that became the stuff of legend. His ship, the Endurance, drifted for nine months in the pack ice and was finally crushed by ice floes. When it finally went down, Shackleton told his men, 'we should all eventually reach safety provided that you continue to do your utmost and to trust me'. From all the accounts and diaries the then kept, it is clear that there was never a time that the Boss was not in charge. 'Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every eventuality, kept his men continually informed and sought their opinions,' says MacGregor. ‘He was adaptable, willing to let go when something was lost and start afresh. We've built an effective set of principles here that Shackleton illustrates. Clients can relate to his story without feeling thry’re being criticised.'\nShackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical endurance and patience. ‘One of the hardest things to do in desperate straits is notating, especially in America, a culture that is fanatically opposed to letting time sort things out,’ says MacGregor. 'If you buy bonds and guess wrong on the interest rates, you hang in there and eventually you’ll get your money back. To “fix it” and sell up would mean a huge loss. Equally, don't be afraid to change your plans if they're not working. If a new product's a stinker, don't keep selling it.’\nShackleton led by example. On the voyage back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, gloveless. He forced his own on Hurley, saying if he didn't put them on he would throw them overboard. Someone else remembered him doing the same thing with a biscuit when they were near starving on the 1905 expeditions: ‘He said he'd leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.' As Caroline Alexander, author of Endurance, the human account of that expedition, says: 'The public appetite for heroic endeavour is increasing. Shackleton exposes the fact that there is nothing heroic going on now. Everything else falls away and he is left standing, the genuine embodiment of the ideals that we are so wistful for nowadays.'\n""}"

"Explore Worldwide - small groups leave few footprints

Explore Worldwide is right in the forefront of adventure travel with trips designed for people who want to get more out of their holiday than just a beach. Our emphasis is on travel to new and unusual destinations, coupled with interesting and original itineraries. Our brochure contains over 100 original adventures - tours, treks, safaris and expeditions - in more than 60 countries around the world. Most trips last from 1-4 weeks.

Small Groups

Averaging 16 people. Small informal groups, expertly led. Giving you a real opportunity to discover more about the places we visit for yourself. More personal involvement brings you closer to the local scene and the local peoples. A stimulating experience for all travellers.

Different Modes of Travel

Many different kinds of transport are used. Often on the same trip. We travel by chartered coach or local bus, by train, expedition vehicle, minibus, boat, canoe, raft, camel, light plane etc. And often on foot. Each trip takes on the character of the local terrain.

Who Travels with Explore?

Interesting people with the resilience to tackle new situations and get the most out of an original adventure. Mainly from the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the States. All our trips are designed to be within the capabilities of almost anyone who enjoys good health, is reasonably fit, and above all adaptable. The majority are aged between 25 and 55. About half are couples. The rest are enterprising individuals travelling alone.

Activities and Interests

It's not easy to describe Explore Worldwide. Each trip is completely unique. So we have divided our worldwide adventures into 8 different categories, describing some of the main activities and interests. Each category represents a special highlight that is an integral part of a particular tour, and of course trips have several different highlights. However, please bear in mind that many other factors contribute to the success of all our trips as a whole. Unique places, unusual encounters, strange customs, unpredictable events, personal involvement - all play their part in the full enjoyment of your holiday.

Cultural/Adventure

Almost all the trips in our brochure have a strong cultural feeling. But a certain number of tours have this as their primary emphasis, focusing closely on local cultures, ethnic peoples and classic sites. For example, anyone looking for destinations of outstanding cultural and historical interest should consider our trips in Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Turkey, Greece, India, Bhutan, Thailand, China, Peru, Bolivia, Guatemala and Belize - to mention a few of the places featured in our programme! Short day walks of 2-4 hours to visit unusual or off-the-tourist-track sites are often an integral part of our trips.

Wildlife and Natural History

Our wildlife safaris visit many of the world's greatest game parks and offer a thrilling encounter with animals in their natural state. Choose from dozens of remarkable destinations. In Africa, for example, you often have the freedom to step outside your safari vehicle and tackle the wild terrain for yourself. You could track the rare silver-back mountain gorilla in Zaire, go bush walking with tribal guides in Uganda, climb Mount Kenya, ride a canoe on the Zambezi River or a traditional mokoro in the Okavango Delta. Most African safaris camp, and full camping equipment is provided. A few offer hotel and lodge accommodation throughout. Elsewhere, in Asia and South America, on trips which include game viewing - say, our tiger safari in India - we usually stay in hotels, resthouses and jungle lodges. In Darwin's famous Galapagos Islands we live aboard a small motor yacht.

Ethnic Encounters

A special highlight of an Explore Worldwide adventure is the opportunity it offers to meet ethnic or tribal peoples. These could be the 'Blue Men' or Tuareg of the Central Sahara, the Maya of Mexico, or the colourful Huli of Papua New Guinea. Some, like the Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert, are nomadic wanderers. Others, like the pygmies of the Ituri Forest, are hunter-gatherers; or dry rice farmers like the friendly hilltribe peoples of Northern Thailand. Many are often part of an 'Old World' culture. Their societies are often under serious threat from unscrupulous exploiters. We travel in small groups only. Our aim is to help spread tolerance and understanding between different races and peoples, with the minimum of culture and environmental disturbance.

Easy/Moderate Hiking

Many trips include a few days' easy walking through open countryside, based on rented or hotel accommodation; also village-to-village hiking which involves some trail walking with the prospect of overnighting along the way in private houses or basic village huts. You'll find such trips in Spain's Sierra Nevada, in Provence, Tuscany, Crete, Corsica, Greece, Morocco, Turkey, Bulgaria, Thailand, Bhutan, Nepal, Venezuela, and many other Explore Worldwide destinations. On long distance walks involving more than one day, all your main luggage is transported by a separate vehicle, or carried by porters or pack animals. You simply bring a daypack for your personal gear.

Major Treks

A limited number of major treks are offered for strong mountain walkers. These sometimes involve walking at elevations over 10,000 feet, with substantial altitude gains and losses during a single day. We may lodge with the local people or rough-camp in the world's great mountain ranges like the Atlas, Kackar, Himalayas and Andes. Or we use a mixture of well-appointed camp-sites and alpine chalets in more sophisticated mountain areas such as the Alps. Such trips usually involve support vehicles, porterage or pack animals. We rarely backpack or carry heavy gear.

Wilderness Experience

Discovering one of the world's remote wilderness areas is a thrilling and memorable experience - perhaps the ultimate travel adventure. Such places have a strong fascination for the intrepid traveller, holding out the prospect of exotic new horizons. We explore the haunting beauty of the Amazon Rainforest and experience the powerful mystique of the Sahara, Great Thor, Namib and Gobi Deserts. They offer a chance to participate in an adventure few people could ever dream of.

Sailtreks/Seatreks

These are among the most original and relaxing holidays in our brochure. We charter local boats and journey by traditional felucca sailboat through Upper Egypt; we utilise gulets (wooden motor yachts) in Turkey and island-to-island ferries in countries like Greece and Thailand. Our 2-masted schooner explores the islands of the Indonesian Archipelago, while a small motor yacht is chartered to cruise among the unique wildlife habitats of the Galapagos.

Raft and River Journeys

River journeys can last from a few hours to several days, and range from 2-person inflatables which participants paddle themselves (on the Dordogne River, for example) to all the fun, thrills and excitement of whitewater railing navigated by skilled oarsmen (such as on Peru's beautiful Urubamba River or the wild Trisuli River in Nepal). No previous experience is necessary and the appropriate safety skills are quickly learned.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
If I were to respond spontaneously to this essay's title, I would say that this statement is certainly a male one. But on reflection, I consider that we should be cautious about making over-simplified assertions and try to consider the emancipation issue from a more prismatic point of view, which is not an easy undertaking .
According to [Reference] emancipation is [Quotation] . The notion of emancipation implies that of equality and, considered under that angle, we are far away from the emancipated human being the Western world claims as one of its great achievements. In my opinion, it would be wrong to denigrate the enormous task accomplished by feminists such as, for example, the British suffragettes. Who could forget that in the 19th century many male citizens were legally allowed to beat their wife, that women were not admitted to universities or that they were denied the right to vote?
But in the following lines, I will try to give a quick outline of what I consider as being important aspects of the emancipation issue .
As I see it, the question of emancipation is at its very essence an economic one. Women now have the opportunity to work outside their home which means that they can earn their own living and no longer depend economically on their husband .
Some may argue that women now have a lot more to do than in earlier days, that they must try to combine the work outside with that inside their home. But if a woman's partner does not help her with the ""homework"", she now has the choice either to die in harness or to revolt and possibly leave him. But many so-called ""liberated"" women abuse of their power and it is a shame that they seem to think that now it is their turn to oppress others .
In many areas of life, our social and financial situation determinates the way in which we will be treated. Let us only take the example of medecine and law: the most competent medical specialists and lawyers are often reserved to the rich. But not only the financial situation may be an obstacle in a person's life: in our bureaucratic society, where law is supposed to be accessible to all, you need a certain educational background in order to manage to obtain what is considered to be your rights .
What are the most important rights a society should offer to its population? In my view, the right to work is one of them. A job gives you financial independence and the sense to contribute towards a function of our society which could be satisfactory for all its members .
It is a pity that more and more people fear for their job or find themselves shunted to one side. In order to safe money many jobs are sacrified, which in the long run will only amplify our problematic situation .
These reflections lead me to consider our political world. Are we equal politically?
No, we are not. The best proof of this affirmation is the fact that we are ruled by people who benefit from the regime of parliamentary privilege and enjoy many other extra advantages. Our politicians seldom remain loyal and honest once they are in power, and their politics are very often far away from the real needs of the community .
The gap between the most and the least favoured classes is widening, and it is tragic that those who rule us belong most often to the favoured classes or have to deny their original ideas if they want to survive in the political world. Those people, even if they are elected by our democratic system (which is far from being perfect) are simply out of touch with the problems faced by less fortunate members of our society .
Moving towards an increasingly egocentric society with growing unemployment, racism, juvenile criminality and drug-abuses the crucial issue is that of the achievement of a real emancipation for every human being, whatever his or her gender, age or social and cultural background .",C1,"{'title': '155_FRUL2028.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good \n \nIf I were to respond spontaneously to this essay\'s title, I would say that this statement is certainly a male one.

"Title: Is capital punishment defensible?

Capital punishment is a form of punishment where the perpetrator is sentenced to death. Throughout the history many execution methods were used, such as beheading, hanging, guillotine, crucifixion, gas chamber, firing squad, etc. During the middle ages different techniques of torture usually preceded the death penalty. Today mostly lethal injection and electrocution are used as execution methods in the USA. Some other countries that retained the death penalty are People's Republic of China, North Korea, Japan, Somalia and most states in the Middle East. Whether this is a justified decision remains a debatable issue .
It could be argued that death penalty is defensible. Committing offences such as murder or rape demands justice to be served. Many people believe that such offences should be punishable by death. They claim that capital punishment can set an example for other criminals and help the crime rates decrease, as crime in their countries is increasing. I would disagree on this and state that there are no statistics that prove that capital punishment helps when it comes to countering crime. If a person decides to commit an offence, he or she will do that regardless of circumstances, so the statement that capital punishment will frighten possible perpetrators is not reliable .
Furthermore, opponents are sure that it is cheaper to execute a person than to make them serve a sentence without parole. This argument is invalid since there was a study done in California which discovered that it was more expensive to execute a person than to keep them in prison for life .
In support of death penalty some may say that legal system is fair. However, there is a racial bias in the USA where most countries which used to belong to The Confederacy perform executions. Majority of those who are put on death row are African Americans. Additionally, most of those who are put on death row are poor and cannot afford a good defense attorney .
 [Quotation] . This is the lesson of nonviolence which leader of Indian independence movement, Mahatma Gandhi, tried to teach us. By killing someone we display exactly the same behavior, proving that we are not better than those who committed crimes. This means that by killing those who kill we became killers as well .
Death penalty eliminates all possibility for rehabilitation. If we murder murderers, we are not solving the problem of high rate of serial killers, but vaguely disguising that problem is being solved. If we want to abolish death penalty, we have to offer some form of alternative. One form of replacement may be prison sentence without parole, but one could refute this by saying that this is no solution since prisons are already crowded. The proper solution would be rehabilitation of perpetrators in the form of expert help from psychologists and psychiatrists. In addition, help of religious kind can be useful for some of the convicts. There are many examples where religion helped people change for better. To conclude with, death penalty does not represent a solution to problems but only an easier way out. We must consider more humane and moral ways of dealing with crimes against humanity .",C1,"{'title': '417_SEBJ2007.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: Is capital punishment defensible?\n\nCapital punishment is a form of punishment where the perpetrator is sentenced to death.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

	Nowadays the position women have in the society is considered to be equal with the position of men. However, some years before women did not have such a position, they were regarded as inferior to men and not clever enough to work and study in universities. Their role was that of mother, wife and housekeeper. Nothing more, nothing less .
	The huge changes in the position of women was achieved through the act of feminist. As a result, I strongly disagree with the statement that: ""feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good"". If the feministic movement would not have arised then the women would still be treated like animals in circus. We used to live in a patriarchal society were men's dominance was taken for granted. Women in those societies were not considered as human beings but only important for the extension of the human species. On the one hand men were allowed to work, to study to universities, go out and come whenever they like and not obliged to help with the house-work. On the other hand women were not allowed to study at universities, or work, they were not permitted to go out and they were forced to bring up children, cook, wash and make all the housework . 
	In addition, in our modern society women do not pocess the role they used to. They are allowed to do whatever they want, they can go to universities, decide whether marry or not and finally they are considered to be clever enough to compete with a man. But even though those changes have accured we cannot admit that we do not still live in a somewhat patriarchal society. We can admit that women are in a better position than they were in past times but when nowadays a woman is married and also working, she is obliged by the unspoken rule to do on her own the housework and to raise the children without her husband's help .
	This fact leads to the exhaustion of the woman. She has to work, to be there for her children and to take care of the house. As a result she has no time for herself. So, if we consider carefully nowadays circumstances, we will understand that not so many things have changed. Something that I should add so as not to exaggerate is that not all women face such treatment. Some men nowadays respect the role of women and the equality of the two sexes. This minority of men give hope for the future. If gradually all men and women as well start to realize the importance of both genrs and the equality of them then there will be no need for feministic discussion .
	To sum up, the feministic movement helped a great deal with the improvement of the position of women.

"I felt very sad. Marley was my friend and I loved him. I didn't want to find a new home for him. But I also had a wife and two small children. I had to think about them.

Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the end of the 20th century, he would replace religion with television. It would be interesting to have Marx in late 20th century. Maybe, he wouldn't replace religion with television. Maybe, he would say that the religion, hand in hand, with television is the opium of the masses. Television and religion don't compete each with other, they cooperate to form the ideal conforming, consuming, religious T. V. addict. One can watch T. V. during one Sunday morning and can find all the things he or she needs: T. V. preachers keep telling you what to believe in, what is a sin (don't forget that also not paying taxes is a sin!), what is good and evil, what will happen after your death . .. Then we have a short commercial break and they let us know what to buy, they let us know that life is funny and easy when you know how to spend your money. Don't worry if you have no friends to talk to: you can talk about T. V. programmes on hot lines advertized during commercial breaks. Commercials are propably the biggest evil because one can hardly avoid watching them, especially, when they are in the middle of the movie. It is also difficult to turn on the T. V., when the chosen programme starts, just in time to see the titles and at time to avoid commercials. Besides their omnipresency, the second danger is their artificial presentation of reality. At the beginning we usually see desperate person deeply in troubles but, fortunatelly, there is a product able to solve his or her troubles and brighten his or her world, which is after using this particular product suddenly full of nice, often young, but always successful, smiling people. Who cares about reality ? Definitely not producers. How does it effect the thinking of people who are not able to see the borders between T. V. fiction and real life ? Are children clever enough to realize that that nice, artificial world is not a reality ? Taking this into consideration commercials focused on children are the worst kind of blackmailing. Parents are those, who are able to earn and therefore spend money, but children are exploited to squeeze their parents' money. Everybody should be able to decide what he wants to spend money on and when a child doesn't know the value of money, it doesn't mean that it can be used for increasing one's profit. Fortunately, there are not only commercials on T. V., but also programmes with some educational impacts and valuable films, theatre perfomances and it is also the source of news (hardly an independent source, but still quite accessible). Key to the using a television as a source of valuable entertainment and of education lays in a creating of certain public taste.

"Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money is necessary to survive. That is a fact in today's society. Money can do a lot of good We need money to buy clothes, and food for ourselves and our families. Money can help us pursue our dreams and travel around the world, in the hope that with a greater understanding of other cultures we can hopefully be able to avoid conflicts. This is not all, in return for money we can get medical aid and send a letter from one part of the country to another. Sending money to charity organisations is an easy way for us to help people in need, who lack all that which we in the West take for granted. We can also buy fancy cars and have plastic surgery to make us look better and to make us more attractive for the opposite sex. We can buy swimming pools or spend money on Beluga caviar. This is where the problem begins. When you have money you can buy beautiful, expensive items to impress your friends. However, they, in turn, will also try to make as much money as possible to become even more rich, more powerful and to be able to be looked up at by more and more people. Greed is known as one of the mortal sins, and it is fairly easy to understand why. If everyone could make as much money as they wanted to, its value would quickly be lost, which is why the amount of pounds, dollars and yens in the world hardly changes. Thus in order to get really, really rich, you have to get your money from someone else. In our greed we look the other way while the earth's natural resources are depleted, the rain forest destroyed and the polar ice melts, only because we simply must have that mahogany desk since it would go so well with the wallpapers, and because we would not look half as attractive if we tried to survive without the hair spray containers. The fact that they contain CFC:s is of no greater importance. Unfortunately, what we seem to have forgotten in our hunt for money, and the power that comes with it, is that the most valuable commodity of them all is the one that we walk on every day. That is right; Earth. So far, we have not managed to invent a way to leave this planet to settle on another one, once this one has been completely destroyed. So until we have found a way to evacuate the entire population of earth, we ought perhaps to think twice about what we are spending our money on and how that item can help, not only ourselves but Mother Earth .",B2,"{'title': '460_SWUV3008.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' \n \nMoney is necessary to survive.

"""One day in November 1982, Obama got a phone call from a stranger-his aunt in Nairobi.
""I am your Aunt Jane. Your father is dead,"" she told him.
After a night with friends in a bar, Obama Sr.'s car went off the road and into a tree. He died in Kenya at the age of forty-six.
Obama did not know his father very well and he did not feel very sad. But when he phoned his mother, she cried. A short time later, Obama's African sister, Auma, visited him in Chicago for the first time. She told her brother about their father's problems before he died. When she was young, his
job with the Kenyan government ended suddenly. He did not like some of the people with political power, and he told other people that. When the government took away his job, he started drinking in bars. His American wife left him and she took their two sons. He had almost no money.
Obama listened and made some important plans for his future. He did not want his life to follow the mistakes of his father's life. He wanted to have a better future, and he wanted to help other people.
At the age of 27, Obama began studying at Harvard Law School. He was a disciplined student, intelligent, and friendly with everybody. He told students, and teachers, his ideas for a better life for the country's poor people. Obama was older than most of the other students, and his teachers enjoyed their conversations with him.

"Hi, Dad. Your supper's in the kitchen.'
John's sixteen-year-old daughter, Christine, was sitting at the table doing her homework. His son Andrew, who was thirteen, was watching television.
'Thanks, Christine,' John said. 'I'm sorry I'm late. Is everything OK?'
'Fine, thanks.' Christine gave him a quick smile, then got on with her work. John got his food from the kitchen, Fried fish and chips. The food was dry and didn't taste very good. But he didn't say anything about that. John was not a good cook himself and his children were no better. His wife had been a good cook, he remembered.
John tried to eat the terrible supper and looked around the small, miserable flat. The furniture was twenty years old, the wallpaper and carpets were cheap and dirty. The rooms were all small, and he could see no trees or gardens from the windows - just the lights from hundreds of other flats. And there were books, clothes, and newspapers on the floor.
Once, when his wife had been alive, he had had a fine house. A beautiful big house in the country, with a large garden. They had had lots of new furniture, two cars, expensive holidays - everything they needed. He had had a good job. They hadn't needed to think about money. And then he had started the boat-building company, and his luck had ended.

"Alice looked at the baby. It was a strange little thing and not very pretty. She took it outside. ' I'll have to take this child away from here, or they'll kill it ! ' she thought. The baby made a strange

It was very strange, but the baby was now a pig.

Finding a good flat in Dublin at a price you could afford was like finding gold in the gold rush. The best way was by personal contact: if you knew someone who knew someone who was leaving a place, that often worked. But if, like Jo, you had only just arrived in Dublin, there was no chance of any personal contact, nobody to tell you that their bedsit would be vacant at the end of the month. No, it was a matter of staying in a hostel and searching.
For Jo, Dublin was a very big blank spot. She really felt she was stepping into the unknown when she got on the train to go and work there. She didn't ask herself why she was going there in the first place. It had been assumed by everyone she went around with at school that she would go. Who would stay in a one-horse town, the back of beyond, the end of the world, the sticks? That's all she had heard for years. They were all going to get out, escape, see some life, get some living in, have a real kind of existence, and some of the others in her class had gone as far as the towns of Ennis or Limerick, where an elder sister or an aunt would see them settled in. But out of Jo's year, none of them were going to Dublin. She was heading off on her own.
Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel. It was run by nuns, and she would come to no harm. Her father said that he hoped they kept the place warm; hostels were well known for being freezing. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel as waitresses, said she must be off her head to have stayed a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn't know they were all still thinking about her and discussing her, as she answered the advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. It said, 'Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.' It was very near the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. Please, please let it be nice, let them like me, let it not be too dear!
There wasn't a queue for this one because it wasn't so much 'Flat to Let', more 'Third Girl Wanted'. The fact that it said 'own television' made Jo wonder whether it might be too high a class for her, but the house did not look in any way overpowering. An ordinary red-brick terraced house with a basement. But the flat was not in the basement, it was upstairs. And a cheerful-looking girl with a college scarf, obviously a failed applicant, was coming down the stairs. 'Desperate place,' she said to Jo. 'They're both awful. Common as dirt.' 'Oh,' said Jo and went on climbing.
'Hello,' said the girl with 'Nessa' printed on her T-shirt. 'Did you see that toffee-nosed girl going out? I can't stand that kind, I can't stand them.' 'What did she do?' asked Jo. 'Do? She didn't have to do anything. She just poked around and pulled a face and sort of giggled and then said, ""Is this all there is to it? Oh dear, oh dear,"" in a posh accent. We wouldn't have her in here, would we, Pauline?'
Pauline had a psychedelic shirt on, so colourful it almost hurt the eyes, but even so it was only slightly brighter than her hair. Pauline was a punk, Jo noted with amazement. She had seen some of them on O'Connell Street, but hadn't met one close up to talk to. 'I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I rang.' Nessa said they were just about to have a mug of tea. She produced three mugs; one had 'Nessa' and one had 'Pauline' and the other one had 'Other' written on it.

"THE SHELL ARTIST

At the age of 83 Peter Cooke has become a master of his art.

There are still many things that Peter Cooke would like to try his hand at - paper-making and feather-work are on his list. For the moment though, he will stick to the skill that he has been delighted to perfect over the past ten years: making delicate and unusual objects out of shells.
'Tell me if I am boring you,' he says, as he leads me round his apartment showing me his work. There is a fine line between being a bore and being an enthusiast, but Cooke need not worry: he fits into the latter category, helped both by his charm and by the beauty of the things he makes.
He points to a pair of shell-covered ornaments above a fireplace. 'I shan't be at all bothered if people don't buy them because I have got so used to them, and to me they're adorable. I never meant to sell my work commercially. Some friends came to see me about five years ago and said, ""You must have an exhibition - people ought to see these. We'll talk to a man who owns an art gallery"".' The result was an exhibition in London, at which 70 per cent of the objects were sold. His second exhibition opened at the gallery yesterday. Considering the enormous prices the pieces command - around £2,000 for the ornaments an empty space above the fireplace would seem a small sacrifice for Cooke to make.
There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists that he has nothing to do with the prices and is cheerily open about their level: he claims there is nobody else in the world who produces work like his, and, as the gallery-owner told him, 'Well, you're going to stop one day and everybody will want your pieces because there won't be any more.'
'I do wish, though,' says Cooke, 'that I'd taken this up a lot earlier, because then I would have been able to produce really wonderful things - at least the potential would have been there. Although the ideas are still there and I'm doing the best I can now, I'm more limited physically than I was when I started.' Still, the work that he has managed to produce is a long way from the common shell constructions that can be found in seaside shops. 'I have a miniature mind,' he says, and this has resulted in boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, little shaded pictures made from shells and baskets of astonishingly realistic flowers.
Cooke has created his own method and uses materials as and when he finds them. He uses the cardboard sent back with laundered shirts for his flower bases, a nameless glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker ('If it runs out, I don't know what I will do!') and washing-up liquid to wash the shells. 'I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just does itself,' he says of his working method, yet the attention to detail, colour gradations and symmetry he achieves look far from accidental.
Cooke's quest for beautiful, and especially tiny, shells has taken him further than his Norfolk shore: to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa and the Philippines, to name but a few of the beaches where he has lain on his stomach and looked for beauties to bring home. He is insistent that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who write him letters accusing him of stripping the world's beaches. 'When I am collecting shells, I hear people's great fat feet crunching them up far faster than I can collect them; and the ones that are left, the sea breaks up. I would not dream of collecting shells with living creatures in them or diving for them, but once their occupants have left, why should I not collect them?' If one bases this argument on the amount of luggage that can be carried home by one man, the sum beauty of whose work is often greater than its natural parts, it becomes very convincing indeed.",B2,"{'title': 'c14fc3db-7782-43f1-974f-4588be4be33b.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'THE SHELL ARTIST\n\nAt the age of 83 Peter Cooke has become a master of his art.\n\nThere are still many things that Peter Cooke would like to try his hand at - paper-making and feather-work are on his list.

"Are you too nice for your own good? 
When I had my first job as a waitress in a restaurant, I soon learnt that the best way to get myself out of trouble was to smile sweetly at every possible opportunity.

I'll sort it out straight away,' I smiled, having served chicken Kiev to a strict vegetarian.

"Garbage in, garbage out

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible. It may not be.

Some rituals of modern domestic living vary little throughout the developed world. One such is the municipal refuse collection: at regular intervals, rubbish bags or the contents of rubbish bins disappear into the bowels of a special lorry and are carried away to the local tip.
To economists, this ceremony is peculiar, because in most places it is free. Yes, households pay for the service out of local taxes but the family that fills four bins with rubbish each week pays no more than the elderly couple that fills one.
Yet the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero at all. The more rubbish people throw away, the more rubbish collectors and trucks are needed, and the more the local authorities have to pay in landfill and tipping fees. This looks like the most basic of economic problems: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish.
The obvious solution is to make households pay the marginal cost of disposing of their waste. That will give them an incentive to throw out less and recycle more (assuming that local governments provide collection points for suitable materials).
But as Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, two American economists, have found, what appears to be the logical approach to an everyday problem has surprisingly intricate and sometimes disappointing results.
Research focused on several American towns and cities which, in the past few years, have started charging households for generating rubbish. The commonest system is to sell stickers or tags which householders attach to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are picked up in the weekly collection. 
In a paper published last year Messrs Fullerton and Kinnaman concentrated on the effects of one such scheme, introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This may sound like sensible use of market forces. In fact, the authors conclude, the schemes benefits did not cover the cost of printing materials, the commissions to sellers and the wages of the people running the scheme.
True, the number of bags or cans did fall sharply, by 37%. But this was largely thanks to the ‘Seattle stomp', a frantic dance first noticed when that distant city introduced rubbish pricing. Rather than buy more tags, people simply crammed more garbage - about 40% more — into each container by jumping on it if necessary.
As we all know, such compacting is done better by machines at landfill sites than by individuals, however enthusiastically. The weight of rubbish collected (a better indicator of disposal costs than volume) fell by a modest 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities where no pricing scheme was in place, and which were used as a rough-and-ready control group, it fell by 3.5% in any case.
Less pleasing still, some people resorted to illegal dumping rather than pay to have their rubbish removed. This is hard to measure directly but the authors guess that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish.
The one bright spot in the whole experience seems to have been a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) rather than pay to have their refuse carted away. But the fee may have little to do with the growth in recycling, as many citizens were already participating in Charlottesville's voluntary scheme.
In a more recent study, Messrs Fullerton and Kinnaman explore the economics of rubbish in more detail. One conclusion from this broader study is that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish - but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices cuts quantity only by 0.3%.
This figure is lower than in other studies covering fewer towns, but is it so surprising? To reduce their output of rubbish by a lot, people would have to buy less of just about everything. A tax of a few cents on the week's garbage seems unlikely to make much difference.
If that’s the case, it seems worth considering whether other factors, such as income and education, matter every bit as much as price. In richer towns, for example, people throw out more rubbish than in poorer ones and they have less time for recycling.
Should we conclude that the idea of charging households for the rubbish they produce is daft? Not at all: free disposal after all is surely too cheap. But the effects of seemingly simple policies are often complex. Intricate economic models are often needed to sort them out. And sometimes, the results of this rummaging do not smell sweet.",C2,"{'title': '4d9ba7fc-b6bf-4352-b6a4-dca527b405c0.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Garbage in, garbage out\n\nCharging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems environmentally sound and economically sensible.

"Title: Mobile phones should be banned

In our high-tech society mobile devices have achieved a great importance. Lately wireless phones have become ivailable parts of our daily routine. We usually feel lost without a phone at hand: we do not know the birthdays of our parents, we cannot recall our business appointment or we cannot contact our friends. Mobiles supervise, control and register each minute of our lives, we suffer from mobile-addiction. Therefore, suggest that mobile phones should be banned.
Firstly, the use of mobiles should be forbidden so that we could regain the sacredness of the private life. If we take a bus or we just walk along the Danube, we are forced to over hear other people's problems and details of their private lives. Mobile users do not seem to respect privacy of other people and that of their own. Furthermore, we are burdened not only with their intimacy but we should be always afraid that someone will call us and we will be in the same impolite situation. A mobile phone can ring at anytime and any where, thus we cannot feel safe and secure as it can break any harmonious moment of our lives.
Secondly, the ban of mobile phones would reduce the number of accidents. Car drivers will not turn off their mobiles when sit in their cars. Statistics, however, show that a large number of accidents is due to the use of mobile phones in the course of car-driving. Communication via mobile phone usually takes away the driver's attention that results in serious accidents. Therefore, we could conclude that if there is no mobile, there will be no accident.
Thirdly, many people say that mobile phones have become the symbols of the social status. The latest model of the equipment you have, the highest social position you are considered to be in. Therefore, many people spend a fortune in order to obtain the most recent mobile phone and keep up with the fashion world. Unfortunately, this process has appeared among young children, too. More and more parents are forced to buy mobile phones for their children, though they could not afford them. Mobile has become one of the gadgets that we should buy according to market-manipulating mobile producing companies, though we could easily live without it.
Many people say that mobiles rather ease than suppress or lives as these devices can prove to be useful when we lack time it is true that mobiles have advantages when we are in hurry, but we would not be hurry if we did not have mobile devices. In my opinion these wireless equipment are the cause of the acceleration of our world. We cannot slow down until we employ them.
To sum up, we can conclude that mobile phones destroy the privacy and intimacy of our lives. We are in constant stress whether our mobile phones will ring or not. Furthermore, statistics show that the use of mobiles increases the number of accidents on the roads. Finally, mobiles have become fashion devices and people spend much money to buy a new model.

"Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
Our prison system is an ideal place for killers, rapers and all those other monsters, instead of being a refuge for them, thus helping them to change their wicked ways. For their own good and our peace of minds, criminals should be converted into better human beings than be made into the worst and indecent human beings .
Going to prison, for most criminals, has become the best way of acquiring skills to help them be better at their deeds, when come out. Some of them commit crimes when they come out of prison because, they had been used indecently in their cells, by their in-mates or even the prison wardens. They had either been raped, burnt, or even beaten up, so they become rebellious. Others learn bad habits in prison, like smoking dagga, stealing, killing people or selling drugs. Thabo, an ex-convict, is now a thief, a gang-master and a drug dealer because that is what he learnt from prison . ""The warden, Thembela, who was my buddy, used to sell drugs to us and I learnt from him, the channels and ways of acquiring them"". This clearly indicates that our prisons are higher institutions for criminals .
Futhermore, James, another ex-convict who sells second hand cars, said he got his skills of hijacking cars and completely covering his tracks from a police friend, who gets thirty-five percent of the profit .

Lastly, I would say that not all prisoners are criminals, so, the society must not treat them like outcasts because, instead of making them it would break them.

Some of them commit crimes when they come out of prison because, they had been used indecently in their cells, by their in-mates or even the prison wardens. They had either been raped, burnt, or even beaten up, so they become rebellious. Others learn bad habits in prison, like smoking dagga, stealing, killing people or selling drugs. Thabo, an ex-convict, is now a thief, a gang-master and a drug dealer because that is what he learnt from prison .

"Eight‐eighteen News 

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people 

The members of our agency are aged 8–18. We collect news and write news reports, stories and articles. We send these to leading national and local newspapers, magazines, television, radio and websites to be published. The news stories and articles by our members that are accepted by newspapers and TV and radio stations, can all be read or listened to on the Eight-eighteen website. We have three centres around the country where young people can meet other members and get involved in projects, and we intend to open new centres nationwide.
Since our news agency started in 1994, when we were called ‘Young News’, over 2,500 young people have been members. Sophie was one of them. She says:
‘I first heard of Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people’s opinions on hip hop music. I sat in a room with a team of young journalists and was amazed by the opportunities they had. Age wasn’t important, they were trusted to do the stories on their own. 
I started going to the Eight-eighteen centre in my city, got some training, then was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen has helped me achieve more than I thought possible. With all the skills I learnt, I got a job at 19, and am currently the youngest employee on a major news website, checking articles written by the journalists before putting them onto the site.’ 

Get involved at every level

When you join Eight-eighteen, you’ll be trained and you’ll take part in monthly meetings to decide who is going to be responsible for writing each news story.
Eight-eighteen encourages skills-sharing between members. ‘Peer trainers’ are experienced Eight-eighteen members who are 12 years old and over. They train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they become more experienced as trainers, some members present sessions to audiences of young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who accompany them on these trips.
Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next new-members’ training will be in February. If you, or someone you know, is interested in joining, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen programme is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free and there is no test to join.",B1,"{'title': '1f86e2a3-eb34-4d7a-b099-14e8525be2c9.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Eight‐eighteen News \n\nEight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people \n\nThe members of our agency are aged 8–18.

"Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

Old people are always saying things about crimes and criminals, also those who are in power or in charge of it. We have all heard of different sort of reasons or solutions but actually it is hard to cope with it practically .
Personally I think prisons or detentions should have been with more supervision, especially when we may have different jailers or prisoners whom are mostly committed crime accidently even if they are really a vandal, smuggler, shoplifter, pickpocket, mugger or murderer. They have to be jailed separately due to the kind of their crimes. In this way some of experienced and hard-headed jailers can not have a team with a ringleader against them .
As everybody knows we do not want them to be punished illegually. In my opinion situation of the prison should make prisoners sure or worried about their lives after finishing their penalty. There might be something beneficial like giving score or sth which shows the way of their behaving. So jailers should be recognized by people in official positions that they could be considered as a promising person or no hoper person in their future .
There for, for instance some promising one can be transferred to a correction center and they can have a better situation now and future as well. Totally the motivation should not be taken from prisoners in order to reforme. Unlike should give them the opportunity or chance to turn to a healthy life for those who have prison sentence even life imprisonment because without that, jailers have no family and no one they can turn to, released from prison with nowhere to go .
I wish we did not have death penalty or death sentence. I am strongly against the capital punishment but as we all know unfortunately we have money-laundering and kidnappers that purposefully do wrong. In this case we have to take security measures and also more important thing is to take preventing measures .
TV violence is one of our significant reasons of criminals. The violence criminal has become a kind of hero figure in our time. He is glorified on the screen; he is pursued by the press and paid vast sums of money for his memoirs unfortunately, it is always fashionable type of movie. How ever many experts feel that violent TV programs make children more aggressive and they will grow up to be aggressive adults. To my mind, we mustn't refer to such a people as thugs, but as social misfits .
Believe it or not, charlatans are coming from the part of society that welfare or in a way that identify themselves like a right person. So they are kind of invisible criminals that are usually successful in their fraud. It is one of the most drastic problems and I do not know how to end up with. May be we should use of detector more before .
From my point of view, impostors or impostures are threats to a healthy society, and government should deal with it and cleanse our society from such these things. More important is, the government should not let invisible criminals off, or get away with or maybe up to now they are not thought criminals in some of estate agency or other jobs .
To sum up, taking measures like job training may help some people to get new skills and find work for not doing petty crime. I believe officials should encourage the prisoners with giving privilege which is related to the way of spending their sentences, because after releasing they need to this kind of supporter even for being a casual laborer also providing an surrounding in prisons in order to improve their knowledge or education can charge totally, as I know someone that he became a lawyer with studying in cell during or over his prison sentence .
The way of bringing up the children is the most important point in preventing crimes and being a good backer for our children help them avoid from crimes .
In fact care free families make them to no good. I think after having a suitable family we need healthy and safe society which is really necessary. For example replacing useful entertainment can be effective. Doing sports is one of the other things to prevent crimes. Having suitable sample that people can follow them as a model or good things can be helpful to prevent crimes .",B1,"{'title': '212_IRMA01023.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals.

"Shopping for furniture 

A report by Dave Worthington 

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people hurried to the shop. There were lots of special offers, including a leather sofa on sale for £45 (but only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (but only between 3 am and 8 am). 
The shop’s normal hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced that it wouldn’t close at all for the first 24 hours. However, it had to be shut within half an hour of opening. A police officer who was called to the shop said: ‘The police had been informed that a large crowd was expected but people just weren’t patient. The shop was soon full and the managers sensibly decided to close the doors. The people outside became angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter and they refused to queue quietly until there was space for them inside. The other problem was that there was a long queue of cars trying to get to the car park. What I really couldn’t believe was that many people decided to just leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few metres to the shop. This meant that the road was then completely blocked.’ 
One customer, Jenny Smith, who managed to get into the shop, said: ‘I queued for three hours and I didn’t have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They didn’t have any choice, as it wasn’t safe. So I’ll come back when they reopen but I’m not willing to queue again.’",B1,"{'title': '9325e2bf-3794-42d9-864f-1c06699080a4.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Shopping for furniture \n\nA report by Dave Worthington \n\nHomestyle, a new furniture shop, was forced to close shortly after its opening at midnight last Thursday.

"MUSIC AND THEATRE

Up until quite recently, I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre. Not any more. After a brief spell working at u national opera house, I learned that opera is, in fact, only secondly theatre. The music comes first. That's as it should be, of course. But I come from a different world, the world of the theatre, where the word and the actor speaking it have primacy, where there is nobody out front directing the action once the event is under way, and where performer and audience (mostly) speak the same language.
At any musical performance, whether in concert hall or opera house, there will generally be a substantial minority of people who, like me, have little technical or academic understanding of music. Some of them will be aware of, possibly even embarrassed by, how much they don't know. Most will be awestruck by the skill of the performers. A dazzling coloratura or an impeccable string section are easy to admire. Even a moderately good musician is showing us the results of years of punishingly hard work. Being in the audience for top-class music is not unlike watching an athletics match - we know athletes are doing something broadly similar to what we do when running for a bus, but we also recognise by how much it excess our best efforts.
Theatre audiences by contrast, come with a different set of expectations. In the main they do not understand the nature of an actor's skill and are not particularly awed by an activity which, a lot of the time, appears to be very close to what they could do themselves. They are not usually impressed when an actor completes a long and difficult speech (although 'how do you learn all those lines?' is the question every actor gets asked). None of this means that theatre audiences are more generous or less demanding than their counterparts in the concert hall, indeed quite a lot of them are the same people. What perhaps it does mean is that audiences and performer meet on more equal terms in the theatre than elsewhere, no matter how challenging the material or spectacular the event. The question is, does music need to learn anything from the theatre about this relationship? I would say yes, partly because I have seen how a different approach can transform the concert-goers experience.
Music in live performance is inherently theatrical, full of passion, humour, melancholy, intimacy, grandeur, vulnerable to the possibility that something will go unexpectedly wrong, reaching into the imagination of the listener not just as an individual but as part of a collective. The conventions which still largely dominate music presentation, including strict dress codes and an exaggerated deference to the status of conductors and soloists, emphasise the difference between players and listeners in a way which often feels uncomfortably hierarchical. On the other hand, the tendency of contemporary music audiences to interrupt the momentum of performance by applauding between movements or after a canicular piece of virtuosity, while it is often a spontaneous expression of appreciation, can also be insensitive to the dramatic integrity of the whole work.
Is there anything to be done? Of course a huge amount is being done. Pioneering work is going on all over the country to encourage new audiences into concert halls and opera houses, and to break down the barriers that make people feel that 'serious' music is not for them. I remember a remarkable event, the staging of Jonathan Dove's community opera In Search of Angels, which followed the action from location to location within a cathedral and then out into the town. It was a musical experience of the highest order, in which the skills, and the generosity, of the professional musicians were absolutely central and it was also life-changing for many of the audience, who were not just there to see and hear but also to contribute directly.
Perhaps what I yearn for in music is a bit more of the risk and radicalism that theatre at its best can display. Sometimes it can come from the use of unfamiliar or challenging locations, where normal expectations are disrupted. This can have startling effects on performer and audience alike. Comforts may have to be foregone, perhaps the acoustic isn't great, maybe it's a bit cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be intrepid as they follow artists into the most unpromising spaces. I accept that most plays get put on in a pretty uncontroversial way, not greatly different from what happens in a conmen hall. However I remain convinced that something can and should happen to change the conventions of music-going. The only authority I can claim is that of the enthusiast: I love, and live by, the theatre and I spend as much time (and money) as I can going to hear music. I want them both to thrive, and for more and more people to get the pleasure I get from being the audience.",C2,"{'title': '16.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""MUSIC AND THEATRE\n\nUp until quite recently, I would have said that opera is first and foremost theatre.

"Tapping into a food supply

In the forests of Madagascar there lives a primate with a lifestyle remarkably like a woodpecker's. Both the woodpecker and the primate, the rare and elusive aye-aye, bore through wood and probe cavities beneath the surface in their search for insect larvae. The woodpecker, of course, uses its beak for chiselling into the wood and its long tongue to extract its prey; the aye-aye, on the other hand, uses its incisor teeth to gnaw its way in and its narrow, elongated third finger to probe and scoop. Though the aye-aye's strange way of feeding was first described over a hundred years ago, scientists have only now discovered how it locates the insects hidden inside the wood.
Dr Carl Erickson, of Duke University's Primate Center, has been investigating the hunting skills of two captive males, Nosferatu and Poe, a female, Samantha, and her infant daughter, Annabelle (Animal Behaviour, vol. 41 pp. 793-802). He first tested whether they found insects just by looking for the telltale visual signs of their presence. For example, holes on the surface might indicate sites where female insects had entered the wood and laid their eggs. Dr Erickson presented the aye-ayes with logs in which he had drilled several narrow holes. Some holes led to cavities containing mealworms while others were blank dead-ends. The aye-ayes went straight for the cavities with food, gnawing through the wood and clearly not requiring the visual clues of surface holes.
Perhaps the aye-ayes were locating the mealworms by their smell or the sounds they were making. But further tests showed that they didn't use these clues either. Logs in which the smell of the insects was prevented from leaking out presented no problem, and the aye-ayes also located dead (and therefore silent) mealworms.
If they weren’t seeing, smelling or hearing the insects, how were the aye-ayes able to find them? Dr Erickson discovered that they would gnaw down to empty cavities as well as those containing mealworms. They could apparently sense the cavity itself.
When searching for food, an aye-aye taps the surface of the wood with its middle finger and brings its exceptionally large ears forward, focusing them at a point in front of its nose. Dr Erickson suggests that the animal is echo-locating, listening and perhaps feeling for reverberations of the taps that indicate a hollow space below. It can probably also hear the rustle of insects, which might move when disturbed by the tapping from above.
The theory that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in the woodpecker-free forests of Madagascar is an attractive one. But there are birds, such as the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas, which do probe for or glean insects from wood, and so the woodpecker niche may not be vacant. Not only can the aye-aye be regarded as a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat rolled into one, but it also behaves like a squirrel (indeed, it was originally classified as one). Its incisors grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has recently been observed in the wild gnawing through the shells of nuts, and extracting the meat of the nut with its elongated finger.",C1,"{'title': 'f5e2dbc6-ccb5-486e-81cd-415f825c057b.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Tapping into a food supply\n\nIn the forests of Madagascar there lives a primate with a lifestyle remarkably like a woodpecker's.

This is difficult for Annemarie because her best friend, Ellen, is Jewish.
This is a different book about the war. It shows it was not only the Jewish people who suffered during the war. Annemarie’s family lost their eldest daughter, Lise, a few weeks before her wedding.
Annemarie will later do what her sister, Lise, did. She will join the resistance party to fight against the Nazis.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

Today getting an academic degree has become so important that almost none of the students pay attention to what they are going to study during that course and whether the units are theoretical or practical. If what is taught in the universities mostly consists of theoretical matters then the student will not be well prepared for the job market in the real life, some experts say. In this essay I try to state a few reasons both for and against the above claim. Some of these reasons are as follows: learning only theories without any practice is like learning how to swim without even getting wet. The job market is and always will be going to need some experts who not only know how to do something but are also capable of doing it. There are always some points where we cannot afford the consequences of a blind risk and here is where using theory we can lower the risk .

Although knowing theories is helpful, as long as a person is not able to use them in real life, they are doomed to fail. Statistics show that more than sixty percent of university graduates have been left unemployed due to lack of experience and practical skills. As a matter of fact companies and factories are tending to employ those who already know for example how to work with a machine or to fix a computerized system. So at this point I think it is the universities job to teach students how to put what they have learnt into practice .

The biggest concern of almost every university student in Iran is unemployment after graduating. This concern leads the poor youths to pursue higher education, not knowing that there is nothing waiting for them but more and more theoretical matters. Saeed Bagheri, a twenty-three year old electronic engineer who graduated from university of Shiraz last year, says that: [Quotation] , said Saeed. But looking at the glass half full, theories are not useless at all . 

Practice without theory is blind. It means that it is not worth taking any risk without knowing what the prices are. Just think of a skyscraper that needs to be torn down, of course no healthy mind in the entire world would take the responsibility of pushing the explosion button without knowing what exactly will be happening next. See! So it is not fair to say that practice always have superiority over theory. Moreover, we should bear in mind that, a society would also need theorists who shed some lights on the way of practical experts, and without whom we never could afford the prices of our wrong choices .

To sum up this essay I should say, I agree that universities should allocate much more time on training their students with practical skills rather than spending almost all their time teaching theoretical matters. In the same time I also should mention that I strongly disagree with those who underestimate the value of theoretical issues. In my opinion a university student should have a good command on both theoretical and practical matters for that as Marx says: [Quotation] .",C1,"{'title': '225_IRMA13002.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? \n\nToday getting an academic degree has become so important that almost none of the students pay attention to what they are going to study during that course and whether the units are theoretical or practical. If what is taught in the universities mostly consists of theoretical matters then the student will not be well prepared for the job market in the real life, some experts say.

"Great sports

Women on a winning streak

To excel in any sport is hard enough, even far men, but women have to be twice as tough. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds they are beating prejudice and breaking records. Here, we talk to just a haw brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill, 27, skier

“It’s a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don’t feel well or it’s windy and you can’t see, but you just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses at the same competitions and get treated the same - it’s a young sport.”

B. Caroline, 22, cyclist

“Two years ago I borrowed a bike to take part in a charity race. I won overall just because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing because I’d never cycled before! I’m well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I’m not ugly and it worries me that people may think I’ve got where I am because of how I look, not because I’m the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money I do at least four hours' training every day on the bike, plus some stretching exercises, swimming and running.
My boyfriend's a cyclist as well, so he knows the time you have to put into it — it would be impossible otherwise.”

C. Annabel, 26, rower

“Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don’t start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level. Also, you usually have coaches who only stay a year or so. There’s no continuity so the women’s squad is basically a shambles. But it's great fun and I love being fit, plus there’s a good social life.""

D. Ffyona, 24, long distance walker

“At 13 I dreamed of walking around the world — I didn't know just how big it was then! But Britain was too claustrophobic, too safe. I was very headstrong; I hated anyone having control over me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk has been different.
The walk across Australia was the worst experience I’ve ever had as far as pain is concerned. I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men think that women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is always seen as a higher risk.“

E. Lisa, 26, saloon car racer

“Some men have huge egos when they're driving - you see it on motorways. When I’m doing well, they don’t talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages.
When I get to a corner, the men think ‘I’ve got to beat her’, so I’ve had a lot of knocks!
You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It’s very difficult to earn any money and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the twenties and have always been classed as eccentrics. It’s great that there are now more and more women taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection always trying to get round with a perfect lap.”

F. Alison, 28, triathlete

“I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up beforehand and when you're racing you really push yourself - you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm a slob at heart and if I didn't make myself do this I’d really be one, c) racing is very social.
Men and women usually compete together but when an event is given coverage in the press, 90 per cent of the article will explain the men's event and 10 per cent will say, ‘Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women’s event’. The prize money isn’t as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women’s Commission, so we’re working on it.”",C1,"{'title': '302a56c3-1a59-4cc4-86a8-aa52dc2bb745.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Great sports\n\nWomen on a winning streak\n\nTo excel in any sport is hard enough, even far men, but women have to be twice as tough.

"HONEY

Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey.

"Little Chefs

For one group of children aged between ten and fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning the art of serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to do the course. Parents pay PS280 for the course where their children can have fun and learn how to make good food.
Class member Bill, aged ten, says, 'I love my mum's cooking and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down with them to share the food we've made.'
Flora is twelve, and she's having problems preparing onions. 'I love cooking. I did a meal for ten friends which they really enjoyed. Then my mum suggested I take up a hobby, instead of doing nothing at weekends. I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't too keen at first. I'm really glad I decided to come, though.'
Their teacher, Philippe, says, 'It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, although the kitchen isn't always as tidy when they're cooking! As adults, we're always learning more about food.

The study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support

If you applied for a job in some countries, you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting. And it would be the handwriting, as much as anything else, that would determine your suitability for the job.
Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is accepted as a genuine science in many countries. Researchers say it can be a useful tool in indicating certain illnesses, such as heart disease and cancer, and can reveal psychological states and emotional disturbances.
Handwriting analysis is increasingly being used for vocational guidance and as an adjunct to interviews. Many big companies now employ graphologists to analyse the handwriting of potential candidates for key jobs.
But most doctors and psychiatrists remain dubious about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for more than 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes that handwriting can indicate psychological characteristics as well as certain medical conditions.
She says: ‘Handwriting is a powerful indicator of social class and intelligence. But more than that, it can be used to assess mental ability and potential, whether a person should concentrate on arts or sciences, and whether they have a devious or open character.’
According to Ms Marne, graphology can be particularly useful in assessing possible criminal tendencies: ‘Criminals all have disturbed handwriting, mostly illiterate and poorly-shaped. Most criminals come from deprived backgrounds and have arrested emotional development. This often shows up in unusually childish handwriting and in going over letters several times.

The person behind the handwriting: examples analysed by graphologist Patricia Marne. ‘I can tell whether people are honest, manipulators, or reliable employees.’

‘Young male offenders frequently have very high ascenders, indicating that they live in a world of fantasy and dream of making it big. Graphologists can tell whether violence is about to erupt, whether the writer is under unbearable pressure, and whether there are psychopathic tendencies. Handwriting can be used to predict would-be suicides.'
Heart and lung problems can also show up, she says. ‘You can't make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is obviously shaky or disturbed. But if over a period of time it changes or becomes disjointed, if there's a break in the signature which did not exist previously, that could be a sign that something quite serious has occurred.’
A severe emotional upset can also show up in a temporarily altered signature, she maintains.
Ms Marne says handwriting can be used to reveal other psychological characteristics. People with writing in which letters form ‘threads' instead of being individually forms are, apparently, devious and clever. Those who write mainly in capitals are trying to conceal their true selves from others. Very light pressure indicates sensitivity and lack of vitality. Originality in handwriting - how far the writer has deviated from copybook script - indicates confidence and artistic ability. Disconnected writing is the cardinal sign of the loner.
Very small signatures indicate inhibition and an inferiority complex; circles over the ‘i’ are a bid for attention, and crossing the ’t’ heavily over the whole word is a sign of intolerance and a patronising attitude.
Ms Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to be able to analyse handwriting accurately, and this has to be combined with empathy and intuition. She feels that more research is needed to put graphology on a proper scientific footing.
This will happen soon, she believes. ‘It’s actually far more accurate than psychoanalysis, as you can tell the whole history of the person, including all their emotional crises, without asking them questions to which they may give wrong answers.’
Interesting as all this may sound, there is little hard evidence to support such claims. Some psychiatrists are highly critical of them. Handwriting, they say, is a product of education, artistic ability and the type of writing taught - and has no other significance.",C1,"{'title': '77450ac5-c881-4439-8699-772c1b8b1e5b.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""The pen is mightier than the psychoanalyst\n\nThe study of handwriting to reveal a person’s character is gaining support\n\nIf you applied for a job in some countries, you would almost certainly be asked for a sample of your handwriting.

"Growing up in Los Angeles, Vanessa Van Petten got into trouble so often that her mother and father began buying parenting advice books.

"Enough Sleep?

Tiredness, it is often claimed, has become the modern condition. As the richer, busier countries have grown, so sleeplessness and anxiety have also grown in the popular psyche. Research in the USA has found 40 million Americans to be chronically affected, and some recent best-selling novels in Britain have featured insomniacs as protagonists, or sleep-research laboratories as their settings.
Part of this interest is in sleep in general: in its rhythms, its uses and in problems with sleeping. But a central preoccupation remains. ‘People need more sleep,’ says one leading sleep researcher. ‘People cut back on sleep when they're busy. They get up too early to avoid the rush hour.’
Recently, a sleep researcher tried an experiment. He offered his subjects the opposite of the modern routine. ‘I allowed them to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. It took them three weeks to reach an equilibrium of eight-and-a-quarter hours. That indicates a great rebound of sleep - sleep that they hadn't been getting!’
In Europe, such propositions are perhaps most thoroughly tested in a small unassuming building on a university campus in the English Midlands. The university sleep research laboratory has investigated, among many subjects, the effects of fatigue on sailors, the effects of airpot noise on sleepers, and the dangers of motorway driving for flagging drivers.
For guinea pigs, they advertise in the student newspapers. Subjects are picked up by taxi, paid £5 an hour, and asked to adjust their sleeping patterns according to instructions. Dr Louise Reyner provides reassurance: ‘Some people are quite worried, because you’re putting electrodes on their heads, and they think you can see what they’re dreaming or thinking.’
In fact, the laboratory’s interest is more physical. In a darkened room stands a motorway simulator, the front section of car facing a wide projection screen. The subjects are always told to arrive at 2pm, in the body's natural mid-afternoon lull, after a short night’s sleep or no sleep at all. The projector is switched on and they are asked to drive, while answering questions. An endless road rolls ahead, sunlight glares; and the air is warm.
The young men all deny they are going to fall asleep. Dr Reyner has a video recording of one trying not to. At first the person at the wheel is very upright, wet and bleary eyes determinedly fixed on the windscreen. Then he begins to blink briefly, every now and again; then for longer, and more often, with a slight drop of the head. Each nod grows heavier than the last. The blinks become a 10-second blackout. Every time, he jerks awake as if nothing has happened. But the car, by the second or third occasion, has shot off the carriageway.
A coffee might have helped. Two cups, Dr Reyner says, even after no sleep at all, can make you a safe driver for half an hour or more. She recommends a whole basket of alertness products: tablets, energy drinks, caffeinated chewing gum. Shift workers, she is quite sure, could probably use them.
But apart from these findings, what else do know about human sleep with any kind of certainty? It is known that humans sleep, like other mammals, according to a daily cycle. Once asleep, they switch between four different stages of unconsciousness, from stage one sleep, the shallowest, to stage four, the deepest. When dreams occur, which is usually during the lightest sleep, the brain paralyses the body except for the hands and eyelids, thus preventing injuries.
Beyond this, certainties blur into theories. It is often suggested, for example, that sleep repairs body tissue, or restores muscles, or rests the frontal section of the brain that controls speech and creativity. But all of this may happen more quickly during relaxed wakefulness, so no one is really sure.
However, there is a strong degree of certainty among scientists that women seep for half an hour longer than men, and that older people require less sleep, though they don’t know why. When asked what sleep is for, some sleep researchers reply in cosmic terms: ‘Sleep is a tactic to travel through time without injury.’
Moreover, people may have had different sleep patterns in the past. A history professor has investigated nocturnal British life between 1500 and 1850 and discovered that sleeping routines were very different. People went to bed at nine or ten, then woke up after midnight, after what they called their ‘first sleep’, stayed awake for an hour, and then had their ‘morning sleep'.
The interlude was a haven for reflection, remembering dreams, or even night-time thieving. The poorest were the greatest beneficiaries of this quiet time, fleetingly freed from the constraints and labours that ruled their day-time existence.
By the 17th century, however, as artificial light became more common, the rich began to switch to the more concentrated, and economically more efficient, mode of recuperation that we follow today. Two centuries later, the industrial revolution pushed back the dusk for everyone except some country-dwellers, by making most people work longer hours in lighted buildings.
Yet beyond Europe and America, the old pattern was widespread until quite recently, and according to a leading anthropologist, in some non-western settings there are still no rigid bedtimes. People go to bed for a few hours, and then get up again. The idea of a night’s solid sleep does not apply. For certain tribal societies, human and animal noises and the need to supervise the fire and watch out for predators combine to make continuous sleep impossible. It seems that people all round the world are badly in need of sleep.",C2,"{'title': '2a4825f7-1190-45c0-a95d-0bb4f986f40d.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Enough Sleep?\n\nTiredness, it is often claimed, has become the modern condition.

"Goat Racing

I was about to witness goat racing. Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was fighting my way through ice-cream vans, hordes of people, food stalls and hot music singeing my eardrums. Even though the general movement was towards the racecourse, I elbowed my way through the crowds in an effort to get a good pitch. An area had been cordoned off to make a course for competitors. Not quite on a par with established racecourses, but on the similar assumption that spectators were to line either side of a stretch of ground along which the participants would travel. An attempt was being made to keep a handful of select goats in order. No mean feat when dealing with an animal fabled to eat almost anything it can get hold of.

Canoe Trip

As the day drew to a close, I started to think about the night ahead, and I shuddered with fear. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn't seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, and with the aid of our torch we could just make out the line of the cliffs; the torch batteries were failing, so we put in new ones, but they didn't work. Obviously we weren't going to be able to spot a camping place. A couple of miles later, Lesley called out that she had seen a distant flickering light and our hopes soared: the light turned out to be moonlight glinting on waves, soon we could hear the roaring noise of fast-rushing water, though we couldn't see what was happening. Time stood still, and we moved on.

How to be Presentation Perfect - we answer your questions

I am not a natural at making presentations, yet in my role as managing director I am increasingly required to present infernally to my colleagues, not to mention externally to the major shareholders. How can I improve my presentational techniques and my confidence?
You are not the only one. Making a presentation involves completely different skills from those you need to run a company, yet more and more senior executives are expected to be accomplished at it.
If you are trying to convince your audience of something, you have to be convinced yourself. Demonstrate your conviction in the passion and enthusiasm you bring to the presentation. That means you must do your homework. Test your proposition carefully in advance. Ask colleagues to identify the 'hard questions' your audience might put to you. You also need to build a positive climate from the outset. Begin with an area of common ground that people can identify with and build gradually towards the conclusion you want to reach.",C2,"{'title': '45.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Goat Racing\n\nI was about to witness goat racing.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Today, universities whose numbers are more than thousands all over 
the world are significant education institutions that educate people
according to profession fields. So which factors make these education
institutions so important? Maybe the first factor is that it educates human, 
the other one may e its professional education, and third one is most
probably its academic characteristics .
The quality of education of a country goes together with the 
development level of that country. If universities' goal is to prepare the
people according to their professions, their first target should be to make
these people professionally competence. Therefore; the education system
is very important . "" How to supply education to the students? "", "" Should 
the students be directed to the memorization? "", "" Should the students deal 
with unnecessary items? Or ""Should they take knowledge related with the 
real life and abstain from extras? "" 
It is wrong to put all universities in the same boat. I am talking
about the most of them. Today in many universities the education is 
presented to the students theoretically. The students are rather passive
many times. They come to the class, just listen the lesson and then go .
At the end of the lesson most of the knowledge they acquired is staid on the
notebooks. However, if they were presented the lesson practically not
theoretically, the knowledge will be more permanent in their minds. They will
be willing to have that lesson again, get more pleasure of it .
In my opinion the knowledge which is learnt theoretically, is exposed 
to be forgotten and its permanence is very little value. However, I think if we 
present education in a practical way and enable their participations to the
lessons, it will be more permanent .
This example will enlighten you. Suppose that you are asked for your 
comments about a country or a city which you have not been and not seen .
But you are limited what you have already read about it. Besides suppose 
that you have been or seen that country or city and had experience of it .
In which way would your comments be effective? Can you see the 
difference? 
We can see this difference in our country ' s universities more clearly .
Many lessons in most departments are unrelated with preparing the
students to the real life. The students are surrounded many unnecessary 
knowledge. So how much of these knowledge will be acquired in their 
profession life? When will the individual apply to these unnecessary
knowledge? This is nothing more than consuming time and labor .
I have mentioned about the balance between the quality of education 
and development of a country at the beginning of my essay. Let ' s talk about 
it some more. There is no need to discuss the importance of the education in
determining the fate of the country. If you look at the improvement projects 
of the countries, you can see the innovations that will be done in the field 
of education at the top of lists. The universities whose aim is to educate 
qualified people should set up their own education policies regarding to 
these criteria. Unfortunately, this lack of the universities effects not only 
the fate of countries, but also the history of human. Have you thought 
about this problem before?

"There are some activities that just will not be rushed. They take the time they take. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with the mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter.
The mind, too, works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can he speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot he rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line. 'Think fast; we need the results’ may sometimes be as absurd a notion, or at least as counterproductive, as the attempt to cram a night’s rest into half the time. We learn, think and know in a variety of ways, and these modes of the mind operate at different speeds, and are good for different mental jobs. 'He who hesitates is lost,' says one proverb. ‘Look before you leap,’ says another. And both are true.
Roughly speaking, the mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations demand an unselfconscious, instantaneous reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London some years ago, my brain and my body immediately choreographed for me an intricate and effective set of movements that enabled me to keep my seat - and it was only after the action was all over that my conscious mind and my emotions started to catch up. Neither a concert pianist nor an Olympic fencer has time to figure out what to do next. There is a kind of 'intelligence' that works more rapidly than thinking. This mode of fast physical intelligence could be called our ‘wits’. (The five senses were originally known as 'the five wits'.)
Then there is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. A mechanic working out why an engine will not fire, a scientist trying to interpret an intriguing experimental result, a student wrestling with an assignment: all are employing a way of knowing that relies on reason and logic, on deliberate conscious thinking. We often call this kind of intelligence 'intellect’. Someone who is good at solving these sorts of problems we call 'bright' or 'clever'. But below this, there is another mental register that proceeds more slowly still. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. In this mode we are ruminating or mulling things over; being contemplative or meditative. Perched on a seaside rock, lost in the sound and the motion of the surf, or hovering just on the brink of sleep or waking, we are in a different mental mode from the one we find ourselves in as we plan a meal or dictate a letter. This leisurely, apparently aimless, way of knowing and experiencing is just as intelligent as the other faster ones.

Deliberate thinking works well when the problem is easily conceptualised. When we are trying to decide where to spend our holidays, it may well be perfectly obvious what the parameters are.

They take the time they take. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with the mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it curdles. If you start tugging with frustration on a tangled fishing line, the knot just becomes tighter.\nThe mind, too, works at different speeds. Some of its functions are performed at lightning speeds; others take seconds, minutes, hours, days or even years to complete their course. Some can he speeded up - we can become quicker at solving crossword puzzles or doing mental arithmetic. But others cannot he rushed, and if they are, then they will break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled up, like the fishing line. 'Think fast; we need the results’ may sometimes be as absurd a notion, or at least as counterproductive, as the attempt to cram a night’s rest into half the time. We learn, think and know in a variety of ways, and these modes of the mind operate at different speeds, and are good for different mental jobs. 'He who hesitates is lost,' says one proverb. ‘Look before you leap,’ says another. And both are true.\nRoughly speaking, the mind possesses three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations demand an unselfconscious, instantaneous reaction. When my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London some years ago, my brain and my body immediately choreographed for me an intricate and effective set of movements that enabled me to keep my seat - and it was only after the action was all over that my conscious mind and my emotions started to catch up. Neither a concert pianist nor an Olympic fencer has time to figure out what to do next. There is a kind of 'intelligence' that works more rapidly than thinking. This mode of fast physical intelligence could be called our ‘wits’. (The five senses were originally known as 'the five wits'.)\nThen there is thought itself: the sort of intelligence which does involve figuring matters out, weighing up the pros and cons, constructing arguments and solving problems. A mechanic working out why an engine will not fire, a scientist trying to interpret an intriguing experimental result, a student wrestling with an assignment: all are employing a way of knowing that relies on reason and logic, on deliberate conscious thinking. We often call this kind of intelligence 'intellect’. Someone who is good at solving these sorts of problems we call 'bright' or 'clever'. But below this, there is another mental register that proceeds more slowly still. It is often less purposeful and clear-cut, more playful, leisurely or dreamy. In this mode we are ruminating or mulling things over; being contemplative or meditative.

"Chewing gum culture

It’s fashionable, classless and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it a day. Discover how an ancient custom became big business.

Chewing gum contains fewer than ten calories per stick, but it is classified as a food and must therefore conform to the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today’s gum is largely synthetic, with added pine resins and softeners which help to hold the flavour and improve the texture.
This was not always the case, though. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin obtained from the bark of the mastic tree, a shrub found mainly in Greece and Turkey. Grecian women, especially, favoured mastic gum to clean their teeth and sweeten their breath.
American colonists followed the example of the Amero-Indians of New England and chewed the resin that formed on spruce trees when the bark was cut. Lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States in the early 1800s making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum has its origins in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance obtained from the sapodilla tree of the Central American rainforest.
Gum made from this resulted in a smoother, more satisfying and more elastic chew, and soon a whole industry was born based on this product.
Yet repeated attempts to cultivate sapodilla commercially have failed. As the chewing gum market has grown, synthetic alternatives have had to be developed.
Today the few remaining chicle gatherers, chicleros, eke out a meagre and dangerous living, trekking for miles to tap scattered sapodilla in near-100% humidity. Conditions are appalling: highly poisonous snakes lurk ready to pounce and insects abound.
Most alarming is the unpleasant little chicle fly that likes to lodge its eggs in the tappers ears and nose.
Braving these hazards, barefooted and with only a rope and an axe, an experienced chiclero will shin a mature tree in minutes to cut a path in the bark for the white sap to flow down to a bag below.
Each chiclero must carry the liquid on his back to a forest camp, where it is boiled until sticky and made into bricks. Life at the camp is no picnic either, with a monotonous and often deficient maize-based diet washed down by a local alcohol distilled from sugar cane.
Yet, punishing though this working environment is, the remaining chicleros fear for their livelihood.
Not so long ago, the United States alone imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle a year from Central America. Last year just 200 tonnes were tapped in the whole of Mexico’s Yucatan peninsula. As chewing gum sales have soared, so the manufacturers have turned to synthetics to reduce costs and meet demands.
Meanwhile, the world's gum producers are finding ingenious ways of marketing their products. In addition to all the claims made for gum - it helps you relax, peps you up and eases tension (soldiers during both world wars were regularly supplied with gum) - gums greatest claim is that it reduces tooth decay.
Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, causes this. Our saliva, which neutralises the acid and supplies minerals such as calcium, phosphate and fluoride, is the body’s natural defence. Gum manufacturers say 20 minutes of chewing can increase your salivary flow.
Research continues on new textures and flavours. Glycerine and other vegetable oil products are now used to blend the gum base. Most new flavours are artificial - but some flavours still need natural assistance.
In addition, one hundred and thirty-seven square kilometres of America is devoted entirely to producing the mint that is used in the two most popular chewing gums in the world.",C1,"{'title': '9b05f3b2-94d2-499c-97a2-6890912e609f.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Chewing gum culture\n\nIt’s fashionable, classless and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it a day.

"Lakes are large bodies of water that are surrounded by land and are not part of an ocean. Lakes are relatively still bodies of water when compared to a river where the water flows. They can contain either salt or fresh water and are larger than ponds. 

Below are descriptions of some of the larger and more important lakes in the world: 

The Caspian Sea is the largest lake by surface area in the world. It is so large that it is sometimes classified as a minor ocean or as the world's only sea that doesn't connect to an ocean. There are five different countries that have coast lines on the Caspian Sea including Russia, Iran, Kasakhstan, Azerbaijan, and Turkmenistan. Over 130 rivers flow into the Caspian Sea with the largest being the Volga River. 

The Great Lakes are located in North America on the border between Canada and the United States. They include five lakes: Michigan, Huran, Erie, Ontario, and Superior. Together they make up the largest freshwater lakes on earth. Twenty-one percent of the worlds surface fresh water is held by the Great Lakes. The surface of Lake Ontario is quite a bit lower in elevation than the rest of the Great Lakes. The elevation difference is mostly made at Niagara Falls where the water level drops from 569 feet in Lake Erie to 243 feet at Lake Ontario.

The end of the 20th century is a witness to a dynamic world ruled b the development of so many different kinds of sciences and technologies that man often runs the risk of losing his control over them, even though he himself has given birth to them .
The improvement of technology and industrialization seem to proceed at the same rate as civilization, both looking for efficient services in a short time. But the rythms of industrial production, which have become part of man's life, determine some heavy consequences, such as man's alienation and loss of identity.

The burst and definite ascent of * easy * technological means have dinned a purer, more genuine world, the inner self, with an invasion of pre-established images and material resources.

Reading represents one of the best ways to stimulate man's phantasy. It helps create personal images, worlds open exclusively to the reader himself. It may lead to a flight from concrete reality, and may also satisfy the reader's wish to start on imaginary journeys and meet fictional worlds, lively and coloured. If books tend to be unread, it is because one often yields to the temptation of doing actions which require less effort, like watching TV.
Nevertheless, dreaming and imagination are so deeply enrooted in man's life that no other activity will replace or destroy them.

If books tend to be unread, it is because one often yields to the temptation of doing actions which require less effort, like watching TV.\nNevertheless, dreaming and imagination are so deeply enrooted in man's life that no other activity will replace or destroy them. Their power is to enrich the mind with no-barrier worlds: microcosms in which man can happily lose himself, forget actual problems for a while and take shelter whenever he needs to, either when he is physically alone or when he is in the middle of a crowd .\n""}"

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

	The concept of feminism is not a simple one. The effects it had upon society, including men and women, cannot be characterized as just good or bad. Once it appeared as a trend in academic circles first, it challenged people's and especially women's worldview. Until now feminists all over the world define the concept of ""feminism"" in various ways depending on their experiences in life as well as their studies. For me, feminists' attribution to the improvement of women's life and position in the society is great. Hadn't be the feminists who some decades ago declared women's independency, women would live until now supporting their husbands and family instead of themselves, would have no personal life, would not enjoy the joy of being self-sufficient and dynamic .
	However, changes in a well-established patriarchical system cannot be radical. Things concerning women's rights change slowly and not in the same rate in all countries. In West women took advantage of the feminism whereas in East and in Africa many things have to be done to improve the bad conditions under which women live .
	As an ideology which once it appeared had great effects on societies, it is logical and expecting to have its extreme supporters. Maybe the people who accuse feminists of having done more harm to women that good, have in mind feminist's extreme supporters. It is also expecting for an ideology such as feminism to get negative criticism and sabotage from those who benefited from the pre-existed patriarchical system .
	Nevertheless I don't think that our society has ceased to be patriarchical. Men are the leaders, men are paid more than women for the equal work, in Greek Parliament women constitute only the 10% of the representatives. Men who are afraid of feminism and attack it in every chance have unfortunately misunderstood what feminism is for. Feminists do not seek to take men's position, they just want women to be in a Cooperative role, to make decisions for themselves and for our society as only men until recent years did .
	As a young girl I cannot imagine myself living in a subordinate way like my grandmother. Fortunately feminism once occurred in Europe influenced Greece and for this reason my mother's attitudes were of that kind that promoted her independency of girls, open-mindness and self-sufficiency. Next generations live obviously in better conditions as far as their rights are concerned and this is due to feminism. Of course problems concerning the female gender continue to exist.

"We are being bombarded with advertisements all the time and a lot of them are targeted at young people. Smaller children, apart from spending their own pocket money, can also influence what their parents buy, so many TV ads are created with kids in mind. 
For example, adverts for drinks feature cartoon animals. Then, as two-year-olds are being pushed around the shop by their parents in a trolley, they recognise the drink from the advert and ask the adults to buy it. As children grow older, some products are marketed to them as 'must-have' items, implying that children won't be liked by their friends if they don't get them. 
As a result, kids are desperate to get the product and parents can be made to feel guilty if they don't buy it for their child.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
	For hundreds of years women have aimed for women's rights. Feminism at its core is mainly about empowering women, about the belief that women and men should have equal rights and opportunities. The term feminism can be used to describe a cultural, economical as well as political movement for establishing legal protection for women. In a literal way, man rule the world, but this made sense a thousand years ago when the physical strength was the most important attribute for survival. However, today we live in a very different world . 
	Malala Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel Peace Prize laureate, is a feminist. She is a Pakistan activist for the right of education, especially female education. Malala began writing a blog under a pseudonym because of the Taliban attacking girls' schools. After she revealed herself, she continued to speak up and took action on global education by opening a school for Syrian refugee girls in Lebanon. She shared her father's passion for learning. Malala in one of her interviews said [Quotation] [Reference] She is considered as a very influential person and Pakistani Prime Minister said that Malala is the pride of Pakistan.
	Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, a Nigerian novelist, who won a lot of awards, famous for her book ""We Should All Be Feminists"" influenced women including famous people such as the singer Beyonce. Parts of the speech from a TED talk are sampled in Beyonce's song, sharing a very important message . [Quotation] [Reference] .
Chimamanda calmly, consciously and convincingly encourages women. Chimamanda also encourages men to actively think about gender, arguing that society brings boys to think that way.
	Women who have also done a lot in the field feminism and are considered as the most important feminist icons are Coco Chanel, whose designs helped to liberate women through fashion in pants and suits; Rosie the Riveter, representing women who have fought in the WWII and reminding us of the incredible female efforts during the 40's; Eva Peron in the 40's who founded the ""Female Peronist Party"" and helped women the right to go to university; Bell Hooks, an American author known for her works ""Ain't I a Woman?"", ""Black Women and Feminism"", ""The Feminist Theory"", in which she declared [Quotation] ; Coretta Scott King, mainly known for her marriage with Martin Luther King Jr. who also helped found NOW (National Organization for Women), Virginia Woolf, arguing that talented female writers face impediments to fully realizing their potentials: social inferiority and lack of economic independence for which she proposed five hundred pounds a year and a private room for female writers; Hillary Clinton, Oprah, Angelina Jolie, Emma Watson.
	All these strong women are making changes since the beginning of the feministic movement. It is important to pay attention to the ambition behind it rather than the word itself.

"Craigie Aitchison

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He came to London intending to study law, but went to art school instead. There he found the traditional drawing classes difficult, but still kept on painting.
In his late twenties he was given money by the Italian government to study art, and became interested in early Italian artists, which shows in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian fields and the clear light there, and wanted to put this light into his paintings.
This led him to paint colours thinly one on top of another from light to dark, but he insists he's never sure what the results will be. He says, 'It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.' Like most talented people, Aitchison makes it sound easy. 'Anyone can do the colours - you can buy them. I simply notice what you put the colours next to.'
Unlike some artists, he never does drawings before he starts a painting, as he feels that if he did, he might get bored and not do the painting afterwards.
Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This explains why his favourite models are people who don't ask to see their pictures while he's painting them. 'If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.'
Since moving to London years ago, he has not felt part of the Scottish painting scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but just paints the way he can. However, his work still influences young British painters.",B1,"{'title': '41.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Craigie Aitchison\n\nThe painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland.

"In hot water 

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time as she can at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. 

Rachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea. She is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she isn't teaching, she lowers herself into a steel vehicle, a vessel for underwater exploration the size of a small car, and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 
'Inside,' she says, 'space is so limited that I can reach out and touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which mean we can't stand up or move and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering samples of rock and water and then three hours to get back up to the surface again.' 
'If anything happens, and you have a problem and have to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button. The outside drops away leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it's like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath - it goes rapidly to the surface. No-one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.'
'I didn't know how I was going to react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship and I got in with an instructor. He then talked me through the emergency procedures; including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react to being in such a small place.'
Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. 'We went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys all blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. 
The Russian team were dropping off some scientific equipment there to discover the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.' 
When she isn't at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. 'Two thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can get on with my research into the ""black smokers"". This is just another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and turns into what looks like black smoke. This pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.'
'The only time I've been frightened is when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a SO-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. 
There was this immense bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle and I thought, ""I'm going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn't happen, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!' 
'It's such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no-one else on this planet has ever before seen them. I had studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real it was such an amazing feeling.'",B2,"{'title': '63.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'In hot water \n\nRachel Mills is a scientist who spends as much time as she can at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nRachel Mills teaches and does research into marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes happening in the sea.

They are used to these conditions, which mean we can\'t stand up or move and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours - three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours gathering samples of rock and water and then three hours to get back up to the surface again.\' \n\'If anything happens, and you have a problem and have to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button. The outside drops away leaving a small circular escape vessel that gets released, and it\'s like letting go of a ping-pong ball in the bath - it goes rapidly to the surface. No-one\'s tested it yet, but I don\'t think it would be a very pleasant journey.\'\n\'I didn\'t know how I was going to react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship and I got in with an instructor. He then talked me through the emergency procedures; including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing me to see how I would react to being in such a small place.\'\nNow Rachel has made six dives. Last year she dived with a Russian crew. \'We went to a site which was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, is a huge area of underwater volcanoes, their chimneys all blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. \nThe Russian team were dropping off some scientific equipment there to discover the effect of a multi-national programme that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.\' \nWhen she isn\'t at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre, Southampton. \'Two thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can get on with my research into the ""black smokers"". This is just another name for underwater volcanoes - water comes out of the rock and turns into what looks like black smoke. This pours out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.\'\n\'The only time I\'ve been frightened is when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a SO-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. \nThere was this immense bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle and I thought, ""I\'m going to die."" We stared at each other in silence, waiting. When it didn\'t happen, we couldn\'t believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!\' \n\'It\'s such an adventure diving down to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, there is such a sense of wonder. Here I am on the bottom of the sea, and no-one else on this planet has ever before seen them. I had studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real it was such an amazing feeling.\' '}"

"Work

Theodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change.

Are you as respected and appreciated as you deserve? Success in a career is no longer enough. Every profession is complaining that it is not properly valued or understood, and even among individuals who have won eminence, there is often bitterness behind the fame. Loving your work, until recently, was enough to make you a member of an envied minority. But now you have to ask yourself what your job is doing to you as a person, to your mind, character and relationships.
This question is crucial. For however brilliant your skills, if they make you a bore, unable to converse with those outside your speciality, if you are so busy with detail that you have no time to acquire wisdom or exercise your imagination or humour, then no amount of status or financial reward will compensate for your inadequacy as a human being.
To counter this, I am trying to discover how work could have the fulfilment of these aspirations as its first priority - instead of treating us as clay to be moulded to suit industrial purposes - and how it could be reconceived to suit us all, both women and men. It would have to be not just a way of creating wealth, but a worthwhile style of life, a path to a fuller existence, to the discovery of unsuspected talents and to a wider variety of human contacts.
However, this remodelling would not mean abolishing unemployment. This is too simple a goal, because the more people are educated, the more they demand jobs that are life-enhancing, interesting and useful. A lifetime of work has to be seen as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its centre.
Even the middle-class professions, however, no longer have the liberating appeal they once had. Doctors are often more stressed than their patients and complain about the failure of clinical medicine. Accountants, despite unprecedented influence, are troubled by doubts about their profession's ethics. Most architects never get the chance to exercise their imaginations freely. Administrators are paralysed by their own bureaucracy. The middle managers, who once gloried in their status, are, as a European study reveals, losing their conviction.
Meanwhile, the business corporations and public institutions in which these people work are slimming. The panaceas of decentralised decision-making, increasing skills and performance-related rewards have not succeeded in winning commitment from employees. In Britain, only 8 per cent of employees 'are strongly of the view that their values and those of their organisations are very similar'.
I have embarked on an investigation of a wide range of occupations, one by one, to see how each shapes and sometimes destroys those in it. I have studied how the notion of what humans are capable of has been expanded in different civilisations, and how courage can be manufactured. I have applied my method to the major preoccupations of our time - happiness, love, friendship and respect.
Having looked at those areas, I am now focusing on the search for more satisfying ways of earning a living. There is no shortage of experts devoting themselves to prolonging the life and increasing the income of corporations and institutions. But auditing our finances is not enough: we need to make an audit of ourselves as human beings too, and discover with what sort of people we want to spend our lives.
How many of us can say that we are fully alive at work? How many of us are really part-time slaves - theoretically having the right to escape from our drudgery, but in reality virtual prisoners of our qualifications and careers, used as instruments by others, working not so that we might become better people, but because we can see no other option?
Take hotel workers as an example, since 10 per cent of the working population is now in the 'hospitality industry'. The amount of unused potential is unbelievable. Many highly intelligent and lively people put up with low prestige, low salaries and long hours.
This is because there has been no serious rethinking of what a hotel is since the days of the Ritz, with its nineteenth-century idea of luxury. A hotel is not just a place where travellers sleep, but a United Nations in miniature. People from all over the world meet at hotels, though they usually pass each other in silence.
A large proportion of hotel staff are foreigners too, keen to learn a new language and discover a new civilisation, but they have the most superficial relations with their guests. Hotels could be cultural centres, active intermediaries between the guest and the city, genuine hosts bringing together people who have not met. Hoteliers could use the knowledge of the many students they employ, instead of giving them only menial tasks.
If they paid closer attention to their staff's deepest ambitions, they would realise that there were many other services that hotels could provide. But they are restrained by the accountants, who say that firms, in order to maximise their profits, should concentrate on one core activity.
The time has come to rethink what this term denotes - from a human, not just a financial angle - and to move on from traditional categorisations. For me, work is a relationship. Now that many people are not content with relations based on obedience, and regard work as an assertion of independence or temperament, they must be given a chance to design their own jobs, and choose their own colleagues, even their customers, within the limits of practicality and profitability.
This means that they have to know how to converse across the boundaries of professional jargon, with minds that may at first seem quite alien. Everybody is clear about the importance of communication, but it is a very different thing from conversation, and traditional conversation is very different from the new kind of conversation which people feel the lack of today.
This is a more intimate encounter, which creates a bond of respect between the participants, and is valued as a way of getting inside another person's skin, with the likelihood that one will be changed by the experience. It is more than a relaxation, because it is the most effective means of establishing equality. Every time you have a conversation which achieves that, the world is changed by a minute amount.",C2,"{'title': '19.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Work\n\nTheodore Zeldin looks at how our working life could change.\n\nAre you as respected and appreciated as you deserve?

This is quite a dodgy issue. First of all we need to understand the initial intention of feminist before concluding wether they have succeeded in their mission or not.

"The History of Farming 

Before people started farming, they went to the forest to look for plants or fruit they could eat. This meant that people were moving all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming made it possible for people to stay in one place and slowly their villages got bigger. 
Some people in the villages became free to do other work, like making clothes, because the farmers could grow food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was difficult when the weather was bad and then some people did not get enough food to eat.

This week. the Summer Boat Show in London is resplendent with fine yachts, bristling with new technology. Nearly all are descendants of the hull-shape revolution that took place 25 years ago. By contrast, my own lies quietly on a tidal creek off the south coast. She was designed last year but, seeing her, you might imagine her to be 100 years old and think that her owner must be some kind of lost-soul romantic.
Perhaps I am, though I doubt it. This boat has benefited from all the magic of old-fashioned boat design, but it would have been a much harder job without the advances of modern know-how.
It has to be said, however, that despite being an indispensable tool in current design methods and boat-building practice, sophisticated technology frequently insulates crews from the harsh realities of maritime life. These are often the very realities they hoped to rediscover by going to sea in the first place.
It's not that I'm suggesting that sailors should go back to enduring every hardship. It's always been important to me that my boats have a coal stove for warmth and dryness and cosy berths for sleeping. But why go cruising at all if every sail sets and furls itself?
The occasional battle with flapping canvas is surely part of a seaman's life. And for what purpose should we abandon common sense and move our steering positions from the security of the aft end to some vulnerable perch half-way to the bow? The sad answer is that this creates a cabin like that of an ocean liner, with space for a bed larger than the one at home.
For me a boat should always be a boat and not a cottage on the water. When I bought an earlier boat, Hirta, in which I circumnavigated Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner observed that she had every comfort, but no luxury. During my long relationship with her, Hirta taught me how wise he was.
Her sails were heavy, and she had no pumped water, no electricity to speak of, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and absolutely no electronics, especially in the navigation department, yet she was the kindest, easiest boat that I have ever sailed at sea.
Back on land, however, it is a sad fact that the very antiquity of classic boats means that they need a lot of looking after. When I had a bad injury to my back, I realised that my IS-year love affair with her had to end. Searching for a younger replacement produced no credible contenders, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch.
The Westerman has never disappointed me. Although Nigel Irens, the designer, and Ed Burnett, his right-hand man, are adept with computer-assisted design programs, Irens initially drew this boat on a paper napkin, and only later transferred his ideas to the computer. After this had generated a set of lines, he carved a model, just as boatyards did in the days of sail. Together we considered the primary embryonic vessel, then fed the design back into the electronic box for modification.
The next version was nearly right and by the time the final one appeared, the form was perfect. The completed boat has now crossed the North Atlantic and has won four out of her first six racing starts,
Her appearance is ageless, her motion at sea is a pleasure and her accommodation, much of it in reclaimed pitch pine, emanates an atmosphere of deep peace. Maybe this is because she was drawn purely as a sailing craft, without reference to any furniture we might put into her. That is the well-tried method of the sea.
In her timeless serenity, she is the living proof that it works; that there is no need to follow current fashions to find satisfaction. and that sometimes it pays to listen to the lessons of history.
Constructed in timber treated with a penetrating glue, she is totally impervious to water. Thus she has all the benefits of a glass fibre boat yet looks like, feels like and sails like the real thing.",C1,"{'title': '66.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS\nThe best boat design should combine old and new, says Tom Cunliffe.

"Then one day, about a month after the fight between Marian and Robin, Will Scarlet told them an interesting story.
'People in the village of River Dale are talking about a fat friar,' he said. 'They say he came to the village last month. Now he lives near the river. For one penny, he will take people across the river in his boat. When poor people cannot pay, he carries them across on his back ! People say he loves good food and a good fight. He is a very strange friar, I think.'
' And I think that man is Friar Tuck,' laughed Marian. ' Robin, please go to River Dale and bring him back with you.'
Robin and Will Scarlet walked with Marian to her uncle's house and then went back through the forest to the village of River Dale.
'Wait here, Will,' said Robin. 'Marian says the friar is a strong man and very brave. I'd like to try him!'
Robin then walked to the river and looked across it. He saw the friar's little house, and his boat.
'Good friar,' he called, 'where are you? Will you take me in your boat ? I have some money and I can pay you well.'
Friar Tuck came out of the house and got into the boat. He came quickly across the river.
'Show me your money first,' said the friar. ' Then you can get in.'
He jumped from the boat to dry ground and held out his hand. Robin gave him a penny and walked to the boat. But he didn't get in. He pushed the boat and it moved slowly away, down the river.",A2,"{'title': 'fd204237-619c-4644-82f8-4a042d080c41.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'A2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Then one day, about a month after the fight between Marian and Robin, Will Scarlet told them an interesting story.\n'People in the village of River Dale are talking about a fat friar,' he said.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
The statement ""feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good"" is false. In fact, feminists are the ones who have fought and managed an improvement of women's situation in society, although there is still a hard work to do. In order to support this argument, we are going to review the following subjects: Labour discrimination, the right to vote, the fight against male chauvinist behaviours, the representation of women in important political charges and the recognition of the sexuality in woman .
Nowadays, the Spanish Law penalizes sexual discrimination as for labour. The last sentences are becoming favourables to women. A few weeks ago, for instance, an enterprise has been charged with paying more money to men than to women, when both accomplished the same work. Other theme to be discussed is the women's right ~o vote, which has to do with the equality in the rights of the State. feminist pressures were used for the recognition of women's sufrage in Spain, in 1931. Besides, thanks to the fight of feminist groups, more reactionarity male shauvinist behaviours are denounced, the agressions are reported, and rapings are punished with greater severity, although there are exceptions, as always. To take an obvious example, a few years ago, and even today in some cases, the girl who wore a mini-skirt was the real guilty of her raping. Moreover, in the present political parties (especially in those which are situated in the center-left wing), women begin to be considered when taking important decisions. In an increasing way, women request more participation in the direction organs. In Spain we have three women who hold the charge of ministers in our government. But the world of women is still a dropout in the political world. At last, we must state that it is due to the feminist struggle that the sexuality of women is put on the same level as masculine one, and it is not so hidden. Before this, man could enjoy with his sex and be proud of his potency (or prepotency} whereas woman, had as her only function in society, that of procreating. With the sexual liberation, women advanced towards the knowledge and experimentation of their own body .
Therefore, the equality of wages, the right to vote, the consideration of women as inferior and less intelligents beings, the higher percentage of participation of women in charges with power of decision, and the fact of recognising their own sexuality are some of the consequences of the feminist fight since it, the oldest revolution of this century, began. Two weeks ago, I concentrated with some women to protest against two men who had raped a girl. They are free because she was scared and left to her country; therefore, the denounce has being stopped. Then the evidence is clear , there is no doubt that there was a rape, even from the point of view of the law. But in a legal way there is nothing to be done: only to demonstrate your rage for another injustice committed against women. This act has done more harm to the cause of women than good: from the rapers' point of view.

"Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
""Juvenile delinquents broke into an old woman's house, burgled it, and then, bestially tortured the defenceless victim. Her mutilated body was left on the floor."" Having read another report of this kind, one pities the victim but finds comfort in the thought that the wrong-doers have been caught and imprisoned. However, there is little hope that those criminals will be stacked away forever. Soon, they will be paroled for good behavior and will set on the evil quest again. By no means does the outdated prison system of punishment help eradicate the crime factor from modern societies. Thus, civilized societies should seek other ways of dealing with criminals; rather than incarcerate them, they should rehabilitate them .
Many people are drawn to breach the accepted rules because of shortcomings or deficiencies in their system of moral values. What's deeply immoral for the bulk of the society, they perceive as natural for the inability to distinguish good from evil. Others, capable of recognizing this distinction consider it irrelevant. Such was the case in the movie [Reference] where the two protagonists set out on a killing quest across America. They knew that what they were doing was evil and immoral, but they were not troubled by their conscience. The undeniable thrill, excitement and pleasure made them continue of their path. They are also people who break the law because their wretched living conditions stripped them of all hope. Modern societies should realize that these perpetrators cannot be responsible for their shortcomings because they cannot control them. Thus, separating criminals from the rest of the society will not change their psyche. The time and the money will be squandered on this purposeless effort. It is doubtful that these criminals will have any qualms for crimes they have perpetrated .
Being confined to a leper asylum never cured anyone of the disease. Quite contrary, having come in contact with other infected the disease progressed even faster eating away the person's flesh and bones and finally resulting in death. Similarly, prisons turn into crime universities. Those, convicted of lighter misdemeanors quickly learn how to go about organizing serious crimes. Instead of leaving the prison walls repentant and willing to make up for their wrong-doing, they leave predisposed and trained to become hardened recidivists. The prison life and contact with ruthless incorrigible offenders eats away their soul and conscience finally resulting in innocent people's deaths. If they had never been put to prison they wouldn't have absorbed the infectious microbe of evil. Had, instead, an effort been made to educate them to become valuable citizens, they would reenter the society equipped in necessary qualities to make their lives meaningful and successful .
However, intimidated law-abiding citizens would rather see their oppressors behind the prison bars. Little do they realize that they do not really secure safety for themselves. The overcrowded prisons are far from housing every offender. Moreover, paroles and temporary releases are issued freely to make place for new arrivals. Thus, criminals have the opportunity to try out new knowledge and commit further crimes. If the so called ""lomiarz"", the man who attacked women by hitting them with a crow-bar, hadn't been issued those releases five Warsaw women would still be alive.

The prison system of punishment proves greatly ineffective. Rather than help the society to do away with crime, it encourages felons to lightheartedly oppress innocent people.

No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them \n \n""Juvenile delinquents broke into an old woman\'s house, burgled it, and then, bestially tortured the defenceless victim. Her mutilated body was left on the floor."" Having read another report of this kind, one pities the victim but finds comfort in the thought that the wrong-doers have been caught and imprisoned. However, there is little hope that those criminals will be stacked away forever. Soon, they will be paroled for good behavior and will set on the evil quest again. By no means does the outdated prison system of punishment help eradicate the crime factor from modern societies. Thus, civilized societies should seek other ways of dealing with criminals; rather than incarcerate them, they should rehabilitate them .\nMany people are drawn to breach the accepted rules because of shortcomings or deficiencies in their system of moral values. What\'s deeply immoral for the bulk of the society, they perceive as natural for the inability to distinguish good from evil. Others, capable of recognizing this distinction consider it irrelevant. Such was the case in the movie [Reference] where the two protagonists set out on a killing quest across America. They knew that what they were doing was evil and immoral, but they were not troubled by their conscience. The undeniable thrill, excitement and pleasure made them continue of their path. They are also people who break the law because their wretched living conditions stripped them of all hope. Modern societies should realize that these perpetrators cannot be responsible for their shortcomings because they cannot control them. Thus, separating criminals from the rest of the society will not change their psyche. The time and the money will be squandered on this purposeless effort. It is doubtful that these criminals will have any qualms for crimes they have perpetrated .\nBeing confined to a leper asylum never cured anyone of the disease. Quite contrary, having come in contact with other infected the disease progressed even faster eating away the person\'s flesh and bones and finally resulting in death. Similarly, prisons turn into crime universities. Those, convicted of lighter misdemeanors quickly learn how to go about organizing serious crimes. Instead of leaving the prison walls repentant and willing to make up for their wrong-doing, they leave predisposed and trained to become hardened recidivists. The prison life and contact with ruthless incorrigible offenders eats away their soul and conscience finally resulting in innocent people\'s deaths. If they had never been put to prison they wouldn\'t have absorbed the infectious microbe of evil. Had, instead, an effort been made to educate them to become valuable citizens, they would reenter the society equipped in necessary qualities to make their lives meaningful and successful .\nHowever, intimidated law-abiding citizens would rather see their oppressors behind the prison bars. Little do they realize that they do not really secure safety for themselves. The overcrowded prisons are far from housing every offender. Moreover, paroles and temporary releases are issued freely to make place for new arrivals. Thus, criminals have the opportunity to try out new knowledge and commit further crimes. If the so called ""lomiarz"", the man who attacked women by hitting them with a crow-bar, hadn\'t been issued those releases five Warsaw women would still be alive. The perpetrator allegedly took advantage of his temporary prison releases to attack women .\nThe prison system of punishment proves greatly ineffective. Rather than help the society to do away with crime, it encourages felons to lightheartedly oppress innocent people. If the societies recognized crime as a kind of disease and treated criminals accordingly, not only would the prisons be empty but societies would gain new valuable members as well .\n'}"

"Behind the town, up in the mountain, was a famous warm lake. Swimmers often went there. That day, two visitors, a young man and a young woman, walked up to the lake for a swim. The trees were green, the sun was in the sky. It was quiet and beautiful.
The woman put her foot in the water. 'Ow!' she said. 'It's hot!'
'Yes,' said her friend, 'I know. The lake is famous.'
They laughed, and walked into the water. They played and swam. 'This is good,' said the young woman. 'Do you want to come and live here?'
'No, it's too quiet,' said the man. 'Nothing exciting happens.'
Suddenly birds flew up from the trees, and they heard the sound of animals. 'Why are the animals running away?' she asked.
'I don't know,' he answered. He pulled her under the water, and she laughed.
Suddenly, there was a small earthquake. Now the woman was afraid. She swam over to the man. Under the lake rocks moved and the ground opened. Hot gas exploded into the lake. She screamed. 'The water!' she cried. 'It's too hot! It's...' They were her last words.
Soon the lake was quiet again.

"Rebellion itself was nothing new. On several occasions under the Norman kings, barons and churchmen who considered the king tyrannical or excessive in his demands for tax rose up to demand redress. This had most recently occurred in a great rebel coalition of 1173–74 against King Henry II (r. 1154-89). The problem here was that Henry’s resources vastly outweighed those of his opponents. Consequently the rebellion of 1173-74 had resulted not in baronial victory but in a further leap forwards for royal power, the placing of Scotland under English control, and the claim by the King to extend his laws and taxes to yet further territory. The disappearance of Arthur of Brittany changed all this. Tired of their lands being treated as a war zone, the barons of western France now rebelled against John, demanding justice. The French King, Philip Augustus (r. 1180–1223), posed as leader of their movement. John refused to attend trial at the French royal court. In consequence, Philip declared that John had forfeited all title to his lands in France. As far south as the Loire, the Plantagenet empire collapsed. Henceforth, the Capetians ruled in Normandy. John himself slunk back to England, his reputation in tatters. For the rest of his life, the determination to reconquer his lost lands was to poison relations between king and English barons.

"Language

You and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability, we can shape events in each others brains with exquisite precision. Language is so tightly woven into human experience that it is scarcely possible to imagine life without it. Chances are that if you find two or more people together anywhere on earth, they will soon be exchanging words. When there is no one to talk with, people talk to themselves, to their dogs, even to their plants. I like to describe the skill of language as an ‘instinct’. This conveys the idea that people know how to talk in more or less the sense that spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not invented by some unsung spider genius, and does not depend on having had the right education or on having an aptitude for architecture or the construction trades.

Climate and Weather

Climate and weather, which are mainly created by the air around us, profoundly affect the lives and distribution of animals and plants. Climate can be a dominating force on the character of landscapes. For example, warmth and wetness all the year round allow the growth of tropical jungles, which are natural treasure troves, with an incredible diversity of species. Conversely cold, windswept areas can muster only a scattered selection of living things. The daily weather patterns that add up in the long term to the climate are caused by great masses of air rising and mixing, for the atmosphere is never still. Some of the motion is due to the fact that the envelope of gases rests on a spinning globe, because air is thin it is not dragged along at the same speed as the earth, but tends to lag behind. A more important source of turbulence, or air movement, however, is the sun.

Coffee

My duties as bar-person included serving drinks but, more worryingly, I was to be responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant can stand or fall on its coffee reputation. There followed several days of intensive coffee-making training, in which I took in more than I could ever wish to know about the cleaning and maintenance of the restaurants gleaming espresso machine. I learnt, too, about the essential principles involved in making the perfect cup of rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week I had to admit that making a decent cup of coffee was not as easy as it looked and I fully expected to be banished to lowly ash-tray wiping duties again. Luckily, my boss was a patient man. ‘Making coffee is both an art and a science,' he said, ‘and you need time to acquire the knack.’",C2,"{'title': '7a332afb-27d2-4cbb-9f95-a01997856beb.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Language\n\nYou and I belong to a species with a remarkable ability, we can shape events in each others brains with exquisite precision.

"Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
Now, it is said the internationalization society. The exchange with foreign country is active in a lot of fields. So it is necessary to study and use English that is common language. To study English is to understand different culture in the country where English is spoken. To understand different culture is to understand your culture again too. That is to say, you can have new view and a lot of ways of thinking. For the purpose, I consider how English should be taught .
It is important to make students have their motivation. There is a difference at the level and the speed on learning English between students who learned from the same teacher in same class. The reason for this is that there is difference in the motive in the learning environment of students. It is important factor for learner to have motivation. Then, how can we have students improve motive. First, from recognition states, we should give a clear objection (we should say today's contents at the beginning of the class.) and summary (at the end of class). Second, from affective states, we should give chance that students speak English in class and curiosity that is connected with motive. We should not use negative word. Teaching English in more positive attitude than a negative attitude brings students better learning results .
There are fifteen teaching methods for teaching English. Each method has both good point and weak point. These methods compensate each weak point. There is no perfect method. We should study correctly view and insistence of each method. It is necessary not to be prepossessed with one method, to assemble a lot of method. We should teach with method of suitable our own method in each case and suit level of students to our class. For example, Grammar Translation Method is a method that we teach rules of grammar and apply this to students and students translates from English to Japanese or translates from Japanese to English. Good point of this method is easy for student who uses fully Japanese to understand. Also, weak point of this method is that students can't acquire English operation ability because focus of class is translation and students can't study listening, speaking and pronunciation in class. This method is suitable for high level students. The load of teacher is light. Students can study writing and reading well. So, we should adopt only good point and compensate listening and speaking skills by other methods .
For carrying out this plan, we need to study hard everyday, for example, we should read English news paper and listening to English radio and watch English program TV. And apply ability for teaching students English. Before everything, it is important to think everything from the student's point of view and teach in a kind manner.",B1,"{'title': '253_JPSW3009.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: How English Should Be Taught \n \nNow, it is said the internationalization society.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

During the past 50 years feminist movements have flourished in many countries and reached the peak of their power. Lots of improvements concerning women rights and freedoms have been made. It seems that feminists having eliminated difficulties in all spheres of life and reached their goals, now live a perfect life. But, I would argue against this wrong assumption .

Firstly, women who fought for the right to get a top education, to make career equally with men, to be elected for high positions and to put on weight of great responsibilities, also had to devote themselves to sticking to high standards. Pscyhologically it is very hard and requires a lot of effort from a person. This leads a lot of women to emotional instability, nervuous diseases, addciton to smoking or even alcoholism .

Secondly, feminists who are associated with making their social life better and ignore men, often diminsh male role not only in their public activities, but also in their own families. Surveys show that these women tend to live without men and cope with all household duties alone and those who have husbands are said to argue for their rights at home a lot. This leads to an increasing number of divorces .

Moreover, feminists tend not to have children. They devote themselves to career making, traveling and self-improvement and many of them say that a child would spoil their life and prevent them from reaching their goals. The consequences of such reasoning are really sad. These career women stay absolutely alone and have no one to take care of them when they become old .

Furthermore, those feminists who have children usually bring up them alone. It means that they make their lifes really exhausting: they have to earn money and give education without any help. Working all day long these mothers have very little time to communicate with their children. This results in a loneliness of a child and cold relationships .

What is more, feminists change men attitude towards them because of their harsh activities. Polls show that men tend to be afraid of such women and would never mary one of them. Feminists are said to have gained a lot of male traits (speaking loudly, acting agressively, wearing trousers all the time) and in this way lost their femininity .

"Advertising on trial

If you work for an advertising agency, the early years of the 1990s may well have been the toughest of your professional life. The recession in business was bad enough. It was longer, deeper and more severe than anticipated by even the most pessimistic, hitting industrialised nations as hard as anything else for thirty years.
In Britain, it meant in 1991 alone that while gross domestic product (GDP) declined, interest rates remained punitively high, consumer spending on almost everything other than staples fell, more than half a million people lost their jobs, and some 75,000 homes were repossessed.
Every single business in the country was affected, some - the vehicle and building trades - finding themselves 30 per cent down. A lot of people - a lot of companies - in a lot of countries suffered. Of course, advertising people are scarcely unique in losing their jobs in such difficult times, but of all those still in employment, they often feel particularly under pressure.
Seen, as they are, to spearhead efforts to support the bottom line, they suppose themselves to be under close enough scrutiny from their colleagues, let alone their bosses. Moreover, they are also faced with the very considerable problem of increasingly being asked to do their ever more difficult jobs with smaller and smaller budgets. They have been told that less must be more.
And yet, alongside these psychological and financial imperatives lies an almost paradoxical rise in the perceived importance of the marketing process. The notion that companies should be making sure they are producing services and goods that their customers want, as opposed to merely what it is convenient for them to provide, is not a new one. Still, it's scarcely unfair to say that it has been only over the past ten or fifteen years that many companies seem to have put the idea intentionally, rather than fortuitously, into practice.
The consequences have been that marketing activities have at last begun to be given the attention they deserve by management, that these people have acquired a little learning about the subject, and that a few brands have actually begun to be genuinely marketed.
All these things have pleasingly increased the status of marketing people, while simultaneously adding to their burden. Marketing is increasingly regarded as that which it is not: a universal panacea. With approximately half of most marketing budgets being spent on advertising, there's some truth in saying that the buck then stops with the ad-people. It is certainly true that if the 80s was the decade in which advertising never had it so good, the start of the 90s saw the industry enduring its worst downturn for a generation. This was, of course, partly a direct consequence of the economic climate at the time.
However, there was also evidence of more deep-seated change which would not simply be waved away as, and when, economic prospects brightened. The fact was that while this recession naturally caused potential clients to review, reconsider and often cut their budgets at the time, it also made them examine more closely than ever before the economics of advertising.
And, generally, in the absence of concrete, convincing and quantitative evidence to the contrary, they had to conclude that the benefits of advertising might be questionable. At a time when enthusiasm to account for every dollar spent was naturally high, it was simply not clear enough to many client companies exactly what they were getting for the large sums of money they were spending, exactly what return they were seeing on their investment. Advertising - ever a business to excite the suspicions of the sceptic - was, as a consequence, more than ever before on trial.
Thus, client companies almost everywhere took the view of one of their leaders quoted in the British trade magazine Campaign: 'We want better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, better media placement, better thinking. We aim to ensure we get advertising agencies' best people on our business and then ensure they are motivated to work their fingers to the bone, producing outstanding work for us.'
Now, while none of this should elicit sympathy for a thoroughly tough business, it does mean that many of those advertising people still in work continue to face precisely the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less. If this is, in itself, sufficiently trying, a number of other factors have made the production of effective advertising particularly difficult.
Some of these are a direct consequence of the recession discussed earlier: the controversy over production costs, and the disinclination to take the sort of risks that are ironically often the essence of good advertising. Other events would have happened irrespective of local or global economic conditions.
These include, for example, the dramatic demographic changes facing much of the West, the burgeoning power of the retailer, the changing needs and desires of consumers, the rise of sponsorship, the increasingly onerous legal restrictions on advertising. And, of course, for some companies there is the new challenge of advertising abroad. Together with the economic situation, it is these matters which have forced many of those responsible for advertising to revisit Lord Leverhulme's commonplace that: 'Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half.' Because now more than ever before, the pressure is on to increase the proportion of advertising that works.
It is not terribly surprising that, at the moment, help for those who want or need to do just that is far from freely available. Generally, companies and the advertising agencies they use have been far too busy simply coping with these circumstances to wish to talk or write about them, while those that have succeeded in keeping their heads above water are often understandably anxious to keep the secrets of their success to themselves.
This means that while conferences and seminars may provide some useful information, the books currently available on advertising, and how to do it, really don't.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value .
We can deal with this topic from various points of view. The first point of view could be an analysis of the assumptions contained in the title of the essay The statement contains three questionable assumptions, namely that most university degrees are in fact theoretical that even if they are theoretical they do not prepare students for the real world and they are therefore of very little value. Let us have a look at these 3 points in turn .
- It is of course a big generalization to say that most university degrees are theoretical - that they are only theoretical and have no practical content. Such a statement ignores the vast body of vocational qualifications designed to train people for particular careers mainly in scientific engineering, medical fields. etc. Many such courses include periods of practical experience in industry, hospitals or other appropriate areas. The courses must of course contain theory as well. A doctor must know how the human body works in order to cure his patient. A civil engineer must understand laws of physics before he can design a bridge. Therefore students are given special lectures on appropriate disciplines concerning their fields of study but they also have to spend a certain time in practice where they are supposed to make themselves acquainted with their future profession. For ex. students of Medicine have to spend some time in hospitals where they are thought practical things - they are thought ""how to treat a human body in practice"". They are sent from one ward to another to be able to cure all the human diseases and later they can decide what they will want to deal with. They can choose their specialization .
- I do not know what is student teaching like in other countries but that is true that a period of student teaching is strictly limited in our country .
In my opinion students of the disciplines mentioned above should spend more time dealing with practical things .
- Many university degree courses are not of this kind however. Those concerned with arts subjects and some very theoretical sciences might be at first sight labelled ""theoretical"". Knowledge of medierval history or works of literature might be considered to be of no practical value. However in such courses of study students are essentially doing practical things - reading, researching, analysing, writing etc .
- This brings us cocnveniently to the second statement that such courses do not prepare students for the real world. It is arguable that if students are doing practical things even whilst studying subjects of a more academic nature they are acquiring skills and developing their power of intellect and understanding. These skills can indeed be of value in many walks of life not least business and public service especially when the information technology explosion of the 20 th century bombards us all with increasing data, information, statistics etc. In this case our theoretical degree could be of help for our comprehension of such demanding scientific and business fields. The students who has followed a so-called ""theoretical"" course of study can be well equipped to deal with this .
- This conclusion brings us to the last of the three assumptions, in that ""the theoretical course of study cannot be of any practical value"". The theoretical course of study can indeed be of practical value as it is mentioned above. However to confine ourselves to a definition of ""practical value"" means to condemn ourselves to a utilitarian view of life. Study of arts, history, literature, music etc. adds to the richness beauty and fulfilment of life and must surely provide value. These aspects are as much part of the real world as a routine of day to day living .
- Now let us look at the second point of view. It could be named ""the role of university education in society"". Society should have an understanding for a general role of university education. Such a type of education should be absolutely different from other types of higher education. Universities should help their students in developing their power of logical reasoning. A university graduate should be able to solve various problems but he should especially have a courage to admit that different problems exist in different types of society. He is supposed to be self-contained after his graduation of the last year of university. He is expected to be able to orientate in various kinds of literature and theory .
It is necessary to maintain an independence and sovereignity of universities. It would be regrettable if universities dealt just with disciplines and subjects that are convenient for practical purposes. It is possible to say that cooperation of universities and practical sphere is necessary and inevitable but an independence and sovereignity of universities must be saved at the same time .",C1,"{'title': '074_CZPR3057.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Experience is a major asset for any job applicant, and this very common requirement in job offers seems to corroborate the statement according to which ""most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world, (and that) they are therefore of very little value.""
This opinion however can be criticized on several grounds .
Although it is true that most university degrees are theoretical, it does not mean that they do not prepare students for the ""real world"", or professional world where they will have to put what they have learned into practice. A
chemist who has just recently graduated from college will probably take more time to make a pharmaceutical preparation than a practically trained lab technician, but after a time, when he has gained experience, he will be as good as him, and what is more, he will be able to understand what he is doing, being able to detect possible mistakes made by the general practitioner. Furthermore, he will always have a kind of overview on whatever he will do, which the technician, trapped in his mechanical routine, will never have. We here find an illustration of one of the university graduate's major assets: his critical sense. His theoretical studies must have given him the tools to think for himself and not to accept everything he is told without further analysis .
University studies also form students to be methodical and organized. they must be able to see at once what is important in each of the different subjects their curriculum includes, and to assimilate it in such a way that they will be able to render it at the exam, showing they have understood it. This will provide them with an analytical spirit, another great asset in their future life, when they will be confronted with entirely new situations for which they will have to find straightforward solutions .
Next to those qualities, university also gives students the opportunity to meet people from various backgrounds: geographical, social, intellectual, ... and they should make the most of it, talking and exchanging ideas, trying to understand other mentalities, learning to respect people who are different from them. Various programs even give students the chance to go abroad, and this probably is the best preparation for the ""real"" world. Their degree will indeed give them the skills necessary for their future profession, even if they first need some time to adapt to its practice, but they will have gained something more essential from their contacts with other people: an open mindedness which will make them aware that their professional or familial world is but a small part of a much larger one, which might rightly be called ""the real world.""",C2,"{'title': '140_FRUC3093.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world.

Their degree will indeed give them the skills necessary for their future profession, even if they first need some time to adapt to its practice, but they will have gained something more essential from their contacts with other people: an open mindedness which will make them aware that their professional or familial world is but a small part of a much larger one, which might rightly be called ""the real world.""\n'}"
"The Vienna Assignment

I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. The way one picture, a single snapshot, could capture the essence of a time and place, a city, a human being, was embedded in my consciousness.
One day, one second, I might close the shutter on the perfect photograph. There was always the chance, so long as there was film in my camera. Finish one, load another, and keep looking, with eyes wide open. That was my code. Had been for a long time.
I'd come close once, when some weird aptness in the knotted shape of a smoke plume from a burning oil well made my picture the one newspapers and magazines all over the world suddenly wanted. Brief glory from an even briefer moment. Just luck, really. But they say you make your own - the bad as well as the good.
I went freelance after that, which should have been a clever move and would probably have worked out that way, but for life beyond the lens taking a few wrong turnings. The mid-nineties weren't quite the string of triumphs I'd foreseen when my defining image made it to the cover of Time magazine. That's why I was in Vienna, rather than anywhere even faintly newsworthy.
But, still, I was taking photographs. And I was being paid to do it. It didn't sound bad to me. The assignment was actually a piece of happenstance. I'd done the London shots for a glossy coffee-table picture book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna, a European co-publishing venture that netted me a juicy commission to hang round moody locations in my home city in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I'd given my own particular slant to daffodils in Hyde Park and heat haze and traffic fumes in Piccadilly.
I'd also reconciled myself to the best and truest of what I'd delivered being tossed aside. It was, after all, only a picture book. It wasn't meant to challenge anyone's preconceptions or make them see instead of look.
It was just after an obliging cold snap over Christmas and New Year that I handed in my London-in-winter batch and got the message that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had walked out on the job in Vienna for reasons nobody seemed to think I needed to know about. Rather than call in someone new, they offered me the substitute's role.
The Austrian publishers had liked what they'd seen of my stuff, apparently. Besides, I was free, whereas the French and Italian photographers weren't. And I was glad to go. Things at home weren't great. They were a long way short of that. A week snapping snowy Vienna didn't have to be dressed up as a compliment to my artistry for me to go like a shot.
They put me up at the Europa, on Neuer Markt, in the heart of the old city. I'd last been to Vienna for a long weekend with my wife: a midsummer tourist scramble round just about every palace and museum in the joint. It had been hot, hectic and none too memorable. I hadn't even taken many photographs. On my own, in a cold hard January, it was going to be different, though.
I knew that the moment I climbed off the shuttle bus from the airport and let my eyes and brain absorb the pinky-grey dome of light over the snow-sugared roofs of the city. I was going to enjoy myself here. I was going to take some great pictures.
The first day I didn't even try. I rode the trams round the Ringstrasse, getting on and off as I pleased to sample the moods of the place. The weather was set, frozen like the vast baroque remnants of the redundant empire that had laid the city out. I hadn't seen what Schussner had done with spring, summer or autumn. I hadn't wanted to.
This was going to be my Vienna, not his. And it was going to give itself to me. I just had to let it come. A photograph is a moment. But you have to wait for the moment to arrive. So I bided my time and looked and looked until I could see clearly. And then I was ready.
Next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow flurries overnight meant Stephansplatz would be virginally white as well as virtually deserted. I hadn't figured out how to cope with the cathedral in one shot. Its spire stretched like a giraffe's neck into the silver-grey sky, but at ground level it was elephantine, squatting massively in the centre of the city. Probably there was no way to do it. I'd have to settle for something partial. In that weather, at that time, it could still be magical. But then, there's always been something magical about photography.
It certainly seemed that way to the nineteenth-century pioneers, before the chemistry of it was properly understood. Pictures develop and strengthen and hold by an agency of their own. You can stand in a darkened room and watch a blank sheet of paper become a photograph.
And even when you know why it happens you don't lose the sense of its mystery. That stays with you for ever. Perhaps that's why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning failed in some strange way to surprise me.",C2,"{'title': '55.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""The Vienna Assignment\n\nI was in Vienna to take photographs.

"Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
We live in a world that is dominated by science and technology, and it strange that so many of us feel on the surface that this is natural . 
Industrialization is the process of social and economic change that informs the human group from a pre1$industrial society into an industrial one. It is a part of a wider modernistion process, where social change and economic development are closly related with technological innovation, particularly with the development of large scale energy and metallurge production . 
It is also introduces a form of philaspical chane where people obtain a different attitude towards their perception of nature, and a sociological process of ubiquitous rationalisation, 
It is true that modern world is dominated by science and industrialization but the second statement that dreams and imagination has no world can not be accepted as wrong . 
Science is not based upon dreams, science needs logics, facts and experiments not only imagination. Dreams gives inspiration to set our goals, until you have not dreams you can not set your goal. First of all, Pakistan was a dream of Allama Muhammad Iqbal and then it becomes reality on the basis of facts and arguments . 
With out dreaming and imagination no one can make progress, who have no dreams than how we would set their goals? 
In my point of view take the example of a businessman when he think about to run away a new business. First of all, he has a dream, that he will be a successful businessman behind it, he sets goal to achieve his target . 
A student have a dream to be a doctor and he want to come set their goals and objectives with distincit phases. First he plan, how to study? How he should give time to family and his friends. He have to maintain a balance in all the things, but his first priority must be study to fulfill their dream . 
As Quaid said: [Quotation] .
A students keep this phrase in mind and works hard it achieve his goal and ultimately his dreams. There is an intrusting example in the respect of these dreams tat comes true. Faisalabad city is undeveloped before 30 years ago. The successful traders, markters and industrilists have a dream to make Faisalabad modernised and developed city. They negotiate with each other to make this dream a reality. So they start invested in Faisalabad . 
Many textile industries opened. Marketrs and traders start business here. Religiously, socialy, culturaly it is a modernized city now . 
And Now a days it is considered as textile city and ""Manchister of Pakistan"". Another is example of Mr. Asif Khan, a motivational speaker, a competent, well reputed personality. He groom, train students emotionaly and motivationally. On 17, June, 2010, he addressed to students and said, [Quotation] . 
It is no doubt that world of industrialization is becoming the base of progress. But industrialization give the man go into world of imagination, in industrialization every one know it is worth and could not go beyond the dreams and imagination. It is all due to science and technology. If one has to make progress he has to be relistic in his real life and also follow the world formation according to scientific approaches. But the world of dreams and imagination give a person new hope and incourage them to go ahead. World of imagenation did not let the man die . 
The world of imagenation has it,s own charm and dream gives hope and courage to go ahead, it gives new way to think for a great world of imagenation! In science and technology we have firstly hypothesis then experiment and then results but the world of imagination has It is imperical meanings in it self.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
We have to face the fact that feminists have caused a lot of harm both to the society and the women's liberation movement, to the whole idea of women's liberation .
First and foremost, we should try to understand how it happened that men and women had found themselves ""on the two separate sides of the fence"". It seems to me that it is all due to feminists .
Feminists believe that they fight for equal opportunities with men. But what have they managed to achieve since they began fighting?
Men smile widely when they are asked to respect women's aspiration to have the same jobs and wages as they do. Because of the feminists' behaviour and their tricks men regard the idea of women's liberation as a very amusing one - and nothing more .
Men do not seem to think much of women's abilities. May be, that is because they see only funny nervous persons, who are not satisfied with the way they live, and these strange persons fight for women's rights. Many of those, who call themselves feminists are rude and fussy, and they do not have the slightest idea of real feminism, which is always ""pure and never simple"". But what we see now, is just a simplification of feminism .
Let's look into the matter of the feminists' ""achievements"" now .
Women all over the world can get any job - if they work hard .
It is not true in all the cases, but in many cases it is true. But if a woman managed to get a good job it is very often due to a man, who has hired her, helped her and who has let her dreams come true, because men are not as cruel and stupid as feminists consider them to be. And what is more, men are always glad to let women be equal to them as far as the question who will pay a bill in a restaurant is concerned. There are the cases when men spoiled by feminists, invite women to a restaurant, eat and disappear in order to give women a chance to be equal with them. Men who give seats to women in a bus died out like dinosaurs. They even are afraid of looking ridiculous and their motto is ""To die, but not to give up"". This is all fruit of many years labour of feminists. Who could imagine such situations a century ago, when there were not so many people involved into the movement! But I would like to return to feminists' ""achievements"". As we all know now, feminists hate compliments and hate people paying them compliments. And now we are told pleasant things more and more seldom . ""Haven't you noticed any thing? I have had my hair cut! - Oh, do not worry, your hair will grow again soon"". Such conversations have become part and parcel of our associating with men. But they adore to give us some pieces of advice, like: ""You'd better go in for sports - I don't want you to put on weight"", etc. I can't tell anything about feminists, but I believe, many ordinary women prefer being payed compliments - and they are fed up of such advice .
Men consider women to be equal with them but not in the cases we would like them to do. Men who have listened to feminists' speeches on TV, on the radio for a long time cannot treat women like princesses, but only like good chaps .
And another important point is to be made: those women, who really want to be equal with men don't speak about it too much and never make so much fuss about it, because they just do not have enough time. They abandon themselves to work and do their best to work as men do and even better, to achieve the results the men achieve. And they do not attract others' attention by their strange actions. That is all because they know: who but feminists assured men of their being stronger than women, although feminists wanted to do the reverse.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Why do people want to go to universities? Some people might say university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Well, in my point of view, people who said that might not be educated in university in their life. I admit that preparation for entering the real world is not enough for students in universities. But think about that, why those people with university degrees are easier to get a job? Doing degrees in university has both advantages and disadvantages .
The advantage of doing a degree in university is obvious. Why those companies want graduator of university? Because those people already have been educated in a high standard although in a very theoretical way.

"Hit and miss of mass marketing

AS ALMOST everyone knows, advertising is in the doldrums. It isn't just the recession. Advertising started to plummet early in 1989, well before the recession really began to bite.
Advertising's problems are more fundamental, and the decline is worldwide. The unhappy truth is that advertising has failed to keep up with the pace of economic change.
Advertisers like to think in terms of mass markets and mass media, but as brands and media have proliferated, target markets have fragmented. Even campaigns for major brands ought to be targeted at minority audiences, but they rarely are. That is the principal way in which advertising has gone astray.
Think about your own shopping habits. If you visit a supermarket you may leave with 30, 40 or perhaps 50 items listed on your check-out bill, the average number of items of all kinds purchased per visit of all kinds.
Many of these will not be advertised brands; some others will be multiple purchases of the same brand. At a maximum you will have bought a handful of advertised brands from the 15,000 lines on sale in the store. Over a year you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred brands. 
Consumer durables? Perhaps a dozen a year. Cars? If yours is a new car, the statistical likelihood is that it is supplied by your employer.
If it isn't, you only buy one every three years. And though it may seem otherwise, you do not buy that many clothes either, and most of them will not be advertised brands.
Even when you throw in confectionery, medicines, hardware, all the services you can think of, it is virtually certain you do not buy more than 400 different brands a year. Compare that figure with the 32,500 branded goods and services that, according to Media Register, are advertised. Let's ignore the 23,000 which spend less than PS50,000 a year, and concentrate on the 9,500 brands that Media Register Individually lists and analyses.
Mr and Mrs Average have bought 400 of that 9,500, and not all because of their advertising. That's about 4 per cent. So you can forget that naive claim usually attributed to Lord Leverhulme: 'Half of my advertising is wasted but I've no way of knowing which half.' You could say that 96 per cent of all advertising is wasted, but nobody knows which 96 per cent.
When you're watching TV tonight, count how many of the commercials are for brands you buy or are likely to buy in the future. For most people the figure seems to be about one in 16 (6 per cent) so the commercials for the other 15 (94 per cent) are, on the face of it, wasted.
You probably think you're a special case, that you are impervious to advertising. Almost everyone thinks the same. But you aren't and they aren't. The truth is nobody buys most of the brands they see advertised.
Waste is inherent in the use of media for advertising. The notion that every reader of a publication or every viewer of a commercial break might immediately rush out and buy all or even many of the brands advertised is ludicrous. People register only a tiny number of advertisements they see and ignore the rest, so waste cannot be avoided. That does not mean advertising isn't cost-effective. Millions of advertisements have proved it is.
Advertising has to communicate with large numbers of people to reach the relevant minority, because the advertiser cannot know, in advance, exactly which individuals will respond to his blandishments. Media advertising works, despite its much publicised expense, because it is a cheap means of mass communication.
Nonetheless, all waste is gruesome. With smart targeting the advertiser can minimise the wastage by increasing the percentage of readers or viewers who will respond; but he can never know precisely who will respond. Even the most accurate and finely tuned direct mail-shot never achieves a 100 per cent response. This is one of the fundamental differences between the use of media and face-to-face selling. It is possible, just, to envisage a salesman scoring with every prospective client he speaks to. The same could never happen when media are used. If the advertiser knew exactly which people were going to respond there would be no point in using media at all. The advertiser could communicate with them directly.
This is as true of Birth, Marriage and Death notices as it is of soft drink commercials. Any advertiser who can net one million new customers (2 per cent of the adult population) is doing well. Of soap powder, the two top-selling brands in supermarkets would be delighted with a million extra customers. So that any advertising campaign, for any product (or any political party for that matter) which could win over 2 per cent of the population would be outstandingly successful: and that, as I began by saying, is but a tiny minority of the population.
The most cost-effective way to reach them may be the use of mass media, but if advertising is to get going again its message will need to be more tightly targeted than ever before.",C1,"{'title': '7.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Hit and miss of mass marketing\n\nAS ALMOST everyone knows, advertising is in the doldrums.

"Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The world we are living in is without any doubt a modern and civilized one. It is not like the world five hundred years ago, it is not even like the one fifty years ago. Perhaps we - the people who live nowadays, are happier than our ancestors, but perhaps we are not .
The strange thing is that we judge and analyse their world without knowing it and maybe without trying to know it. The only thing that is certain is that the world is changing and it is changing so fast that even we cannot notice it. Sciece has developed to such an extent that it is difficult to believe this can be true. A simple but quite impressive example of this development is the genetic engineering. Scientists have achieved something which was considered impossible and even monstrous before. Probably just in a few years they will be able to create a rational human being. Technology and industrialisation have also developed and in the present moment they do not stop developing. The consumers are overwhelmed by all kinds of products and goods. Technology is everywhere - in the houses, in the streets, in the shopping centers. We cannot run away from it even if we want to .
On the other hand we do need all these new technical products. We can no longer imagine our lives without a TV set or without a telephone. Computer systems like Internet enable us to communicate easy and fast. We are modern people and as modern people we are surrounded by all these things, by all these products of science technology and industry. This is our world. Whether we like it or not we must live in it. But all these inventions and innovations cannot change us - we remain human beings. With or without a washing machine we do not turn into animals. People are capable of adjusting to their environment and to remain humans .
In my opinion, technology cannot change us so much and to make us forget what is to dream and imagine. There is always place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world. If there was not imagination our lives would have been so dull and colourless and everybody would have gone crazy. I do not think that we can live without dreaming. Because if we do not dream we would not have any aims to achieve, we would not see a light in the end of the tunnel of life. It is our imagination that helps us go through the difficult moments in life. For example when your boyfriend leaves you it is such a relief to imagine that you will smash his face the next time you see him .
This is just a small relief but sometimes it helps you to feel better. But imagination helps not only in such cases it helps us to create our own world in our minds. A world where we could go whenever we feel the need to escape from the real one. A world where everything is the way we want it to be, where people are good and love is real. It is a fairy tale where we can go and relax, it is the improved mirror image of reality .
Imagination and dreaming will always have place in our modern or not so modern world .
Without them neither art nor literature will exist. And the fact that they still exist is a proof of the existence of imagination.

But imagination helps not only in such cases it helps us to create our own world in our minds. A world where we could go whenever we feel the need to escape from the real one. A world where everything is the way we want it to be, where people are good and love is real. It is a fairy tale where we can go and relax, it is the improved mirror image of reality .\nImagination and dreaming will always have place in our modern or not so modern world .\nWithout them neither art nor literature will exist. And the fact that they still exist is a proof of the existence of imagination. If it was not for it I would not be able to write this essay, would I?\n'}"

"Beginner Takes All
Even before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year. A first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, it has earned its author record-breaking sums. He talks here about his inspiration and his triumph
The first months of the year were not kind to Nicholas Evans, screenwriter, producer and aspiring director. The year began badly when Life and Limb, a film project he had been working on for months, fell through 'almost overnight'. His disappointment mingled with stomach-churning worry: it had been two years since he had earned any money and the promise of that film had been the only buffer between him and an increasingly irate bank manager.
A wise man, finding himself in Evans' position, would have got a job. He could have gone back to being a television executive, or begun a television project that had been on hold. Instead, he made a decision that most people, Evans included, would consider insane. He bought a ticket to America and set off for three months to research his first novel.
Although he was acting very much on impulse, the seeds for the story had been with him for some time, sown by a farrier he met on Dartmoor while staying with a friend. The farrier had told him the story of a docile horse that had turned, no one knew why, into a fiend. Its owners were desperate until they heard of a gypsy who, simply by talking to the animal, transformed its temperament in a matter of hours. Such men, the farrier said, were known as 'horse whisperers'.
Evans' imagination was captured. He began researching the subject with a view to writing a screenplay - he was, after all, a film-maker. But disillusionment with the film world following the demise of Life and Limb prompted him to write the story as a book. And so throughout the spring he drove across the US, stopping at ranches and learning about horses and the men who work with them.
'It was a funny time,' he says now. 'I was observing people, but essentially [ was alone and I really felt as though my life was falling apart. ['d tried for ten years to make a go of it as a film-maker, and here 1was, hugely in debt and wondering how [ was going to feed the children, and thinking maybe it was all just folly.'
He thought that again towards the end of August, by which time he had returned home and written the first half of the book. 'At that point the bank manager was getting really very heavy with us, and I needed to know whether it was worth going on. I plucked up the courage to show it to a friend who was a literary agent; he read it and said it was ""fine"".'
When pushed, he ventured that Evans might get $30,000 as an advance on the book. 'I had in mind how much 1 needed to payoff a bit of the overdraft and keep us going, and it was more than that. ['d spent seven months on The Horse Whisperer, and there were at least another two to go. $30,000 was a really difficult figure. I was also advised to write a 12-page synopsis of the remainder of the book.'
In October. together with the first two hundred pages of the novel. this was sent to seven UK publishers on the eve of their departure for the annual spending spree at the internationally renowned Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days his agent was on the telephone to report that he had just turned down the first offer of $75,000. 'I said, ""You what?"" And he said, ""It's OK, I just sense something is happening"". '
The events that followed have become publishing history. Within a week - a week of hotly contested auctions - the novel had been sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for 5550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for 53.I5 million, both record-breaking advances for a first novel.
'We couldn't believe it; we sat there with our jaws gaping. W e'd never sent the manuscript to New York, we still don't know how it got there,' Evans says. Nor did they send it to Hollywood, but within that same week the major studios were fighting over it. 'My agent in the UK wisely involved an agent over there and when he phoned us to say, ""I think we can get $3 million outright,"" we laughed in disbelief.'
As they all agreed to this sum, it was decided that they should each 'pitch' to Evans. And so, one night in October, he sat in his study while four great film-makers rang, one after the other, to beg for the privilege of paying 53 million for an unfinished novel. Evans told me all this as we sat drinking coffee on a wooden verandah perched above the leafy garden of his home. He said that he had since turned down an offer to write the screenplay of Tile Horse Whisperer.
'It's all been such a fairy tale so far. I don't want to spoil it. Writing at that level is a very tough business, and I don't want to become an employee of these people who I like and who have paid me so much money. I'd hate to find myself writing a draft or two and then have them say, ""Thanks Nick, but now we'll bring in so-and-so"". '
He would be involved, he said, but at arm's length. The success of his novel had inevitably brought forth the offer of new backing for Life and Limb, but he was no longer sure that he wanted to make it. 'I think that I would be foolish not to write another novel,' he said.",C1,"{'title': '68.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Beginner Takes All\nEven before it was published, The Horse Whisperer was the hottest book of the year.

"We are Talking Big Boots here. Really BIGTIME Boots.
I stood in my 800-dollar-each designer-label cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert sand. Money no object. I wore the whole truly cowboy outfit and if you had the outfit you might be a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn't working. I squinted info the morning sun looking out at the Arizona mountains and I had to admit, I was not at home on the range,
Flying in from Denver just after dawn, I had the feeling that I just might pass far an ol' cowhand coming in from the sky. The feeling didn't last past the first real cowboy in the luggage hall of Phoenix airport. He was wearing a sweat-stained I-shirt, needed a shave, and was hoisting a dirty canvas bag off the conveyer belt when he caught sight of my brand new cowboy boots. He slowly raised one eyebrow and moved off out of the door without looking back.
There ought to be, somewhere, hanging in a closet, a suit of clothes an ex-racing driver can put on without feeling like he is from another planet. Something he could wear so that wherever he goes he doesn't get the feeling that everybody is talking another language and doing whatever they do at half speed. I liked, no, not liked... I flatout loved being a racing driver, driving racing cars. I am addicted to it and it is all I know how to do. But I don't do it any more. I couldn't if I wanted to. Question is, I thought, looking into the mean, rust-coloured rock of the mountains in the distance, what do I do now?
A racing driver should have one or two fall-back identities lined up for when he climbs out of his car. I thought I did, but when I reached for them they just disappeared. How about: an ex-racing driver adds colour to the commentary direct from the trackside? 'We got fifteen guys, all of them former Indy and Formula One drivers, fifteen guys in front of you, Forrest, standing in line to be colour commentators. We'll call you.'
Well then, how about: an ex-racing driver coins a partnership to sell classic cars? That lasted nearly all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers und meetings with bankers. But it was the year nobody was buying old Ferraris and Honda was 'reviewing' its dealer list. So in the end I gracefully withdrew before there was nothing to withdraw from. Being an 'ex' anything is depressing work. I mean you tell me, how badly do you want to hear about how I was almost the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends in 'almost'. And even if I had been world champion you could probably just about stand to listen to the story for five minutes before your ears turned to cement. Last year's champion was last year.
Not that I want sympathy. Which is just as well, since I don't get any. Well, why should I? I had a good run, made money and hung on to enough. But oh, man, I miss the heat of slipping into that graceful, elegant, shrink-wrapped super-tech machine with seven hundred horsepower behind my neck. Zero to a hundred and fifty miles an hour in 4,9 seconds. And yes, I miss coming within an eyelash of killing myself every race or so. I miss the bright and gorgeous people and the reporters who acted as if what I said mattered. Being famous, even in a minor way, isn't all bad. Businessmen and politicians bragged to their friends that they knew me. Little boys slid under fences to get my autograph. And now that I don't drive a racing car... Only last week the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and I have time in the afternoon. And let me just check, but I think tomorrow is free, so much empty time.
I looked up into the soft blue morning sky. No buzzards overhead. Maybe Arizona doesn't have buzzards. But a couple of little brown birds in a saguaro cactus just in front of me were giving me advice, something like 'get away from our nest before we sing our hearts out'.

"I pulled my woolen hat down tighter and enjoyed the smell of wood and smoke from the small fire in front of me. I was back in Nepal after almost a year, and I felt good. The quietness of the Himalayan morning was very different from the noise and dirty air of Beijing. 
I was now living in Beijing, and I was a business director for Microsoft in China. I was excited by my new job, but there were already problems with life in Beijing. The city was very cold and there was no space in the city for running or cycling, and I had a bad cough from the unclean air.

"The Lure of the Kitchen

When I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef. Among my contemporaries, this was an unusual choice. Cooking was not one of the plum jobs that most of us wanted. It is, on the face of it, an unattractive profession. Chefs lead notoriously harsh lives: the work is long, pressured, menial - and badly paid.
But such considerations didn’t put me off. I was unhappy at university. The work was hard;
the social scene was insular and self-important. Being a chef seemed the perfect antidote to intellectual and social posturing. It promised a seriousness and integrity lacking in my college life.
But my desire to cook was not simply a reaction to being a student. It also expressed an aesthetic ideal. My first glimpse of this ideal came when I ate a meal at a famous London restaurant. It was a revelation. I still clearly remember my starter. I finished that meal wanting to prostrate myself weeping, at the feet of the chef who had made it. I felt warm and airy for days afterwards.
After this, I developed an intense desire to uncover the secrets of this strange, fabulous art. I transformed my student life into an extended preparation for my assault on the culinary world. My history degree became a hollow pretence, distracting me from my true course. I acquired my real education haphazardly and deficiently by reading cookbooks, roaming markets and delicatessens and preparing extravagant meals.

Extract from a novel

The school's swimming instructor was an ex-drill sergeant, small and muscle-bound, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the pools edge, put my hands above my head and roll forwards, pushing myself off with my feet. I practised that manoeuvre until the hour was up. The next visit, he got me standing upright, and diving off the edge. The instructor was a martinet and every time I surfaced he looked at me with distaste: ‘Don’t look down, look up!’ 'Keep your legs straight.’ 'Point your toes I said!’ The next week, I went up onto the high board. It was a fixed board and its front edge bent slightly downward. It seemed outrageously high as I stood there, trying to work up my courage. Gradually the echoing voices disappeared and I felt as if I were cocooned in silence. I waved my arms vaguely in the way I’d been taught, tried to look up, not down, and launched myself into space. For a brief moment, I was flying. When I hit the water, I crumpled ignominiously, and my legs were all over the place. The instructor looked at me with contempt and shook his head. But even he could not diminish my euphoria. That’s what they mean by 'free as a bird', I thought.

The Traveller

To those of us for whom a comfortable bed, running water and the probability of living at least until tomorrow are of prime importance, the phenomenon of the traveller appears as incomprehensible as it is intriguing. Here are people who have succumbed to the treacherous seduction of the unknown, who actually choose to put their lives at risk by climbing the sheer and icy face of an avalanche-ridden mountain; who sail alone in frail craft through towering seas; who will eat maggots and river insects if nothing more palatable is on offer and who can live, day and night for months on end, in the shadow and the promise of the unknown.
It is easy to dismiss such people as oddities - as indeed they are - to be relegated to the ranks of the truly eccentric: hermits, freefall divers or indeed writers. That they exist cannot be denied, but the strange, uncomfortable world they occupy lies well outside our everyday experience and can be dismissed, we tell ourselves, as an irrelevancy. We can shrug our shoulders and return thankfully to our world of microwave ovens and answerphones, glad that the only risks to our own health are predictable ones such as making a suicidal dash across a city street.

SAILING

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, saying it is not his element, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a world-class sailor, though he is obviously a competent one. His overriding reason for sailing is that, being a writer, he likes to write about having sailed. Sailing is guaranteed to provide alarms and achievements for his pen to celebrate.
Raban's little boat carries an electronic device that instantly gives mariners their position to within a few metres, anywhere on the earth’s surface. Strongly as he approves of this instrument, there is more than a touch of primitivism in Raban’s attitude to other sea-faring aids. He thinks the invention of the compass was a disaster, causing a ‘fundamental rift in the relationship between man and sea’. Raban maintains that since it came into use, perhaps a thousand years ago, it has become the main object of the steersman’s gaze, with the result that he no longer has to study the waves and feel the sea. And the ocean, once a place with all sorts of things going on in it, is now reduced to a mere space. Since his job is merely to keep steady on a course, the helmsman can be replaced for long stretches by an autopilot. This may be why Raban had time to look so carefully at the waves.",C2,"{'title': '8ea41311-d9ae-43d6-90bd-74d1a9fd3069.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""The Lure of the Kitchen\n\nWhen I was at university I decided I wanted to be a chef.

"The first written story of the Loch Ness monster is in a text written in the year 565AD by a Celtic biographer: this writer describes how a man was attacked by a monster while he was swimming in the river Ness. Perhaps the legend already existed in those days: it has certainly existed for many centuries in Scottish folklore.
    However, the story of the monster was not very well-known in England for one simple reason: Loch Ness is a very long way from the rest of Britain. Until the age of the railway, very few people ever went to the Highlands of Scotland...except soldiers or officials from the cities of the Scottish Lowlands. No-one else had any reason to go there: the north of Scotland was wild and desolate, wet and generally cold, and inhabited more by sheep than by people.
   The myth became big news in 1930; three men, out in a boat on the lake, said that they had seen a monster. Immediately, several other people said that they had seen one too. In 1933, a man took the first ""photo"" of the monster, from a distance of about 100 metres. The photo was not clear, but Kodak said that the photo was real. The most famous photo of all was taken in 1934 by a London surgeon; it seems to show a long neck and a small head sticking up out of the water.

Perhaps the legend already existed in those days: it has certainly existed for many centuries in Scottish folklore.\n    However, the story of the monster was not very well-known in England for one simple reason: Loch Ness is a very long way from the rest of Britain. Until the age of the railway, very few people ever went to the Highlands of Scotland...except soldiers or officials from the cities of the Scottish Lowlands. No-one else had any reason to go there: the north of Scotland was wild and desolate, wet and generally cold, and inhabited more by sheep than by people.\n   The myth became big news in 1930; three men, out in a boat on the lake, said that they had seen a monster. Immediately, several other people said that they had seen one too. In 1933, a man took the first ""photo"" of the monster, from a distance of about 100 metres. The photo was not clear, but Kodak said that the photo was real. The most famous photo of all was taken in 1934 by a London surgeon; it seems to show a long neck and a small head sticking up out of the water. ""Nessie"" - if the photo is real - looks something like a dinosaur.\n    A lot of other photos have been taken since then, but none of them have been clear. Obviously, if there is a monster, it is a shy one! It doesn\'t often come to the surface, and it never does so near the shore on a sunny afternoon in summer! \n\n'}"

"Credit Cards 
At age 21, you may be able to have a credit card in your own name. To do so, you will need to show the lender that you can use a credit card responsibly. First, the lender will want to know your income, or how much money you earn for your work. Second, they’ll want to see if you have a history of paying your bills on time. This information helps the lender determine whether they can have confidence in you to repay your debts. 
Most lenders charge a fee for lending money. This fee varies and is referred to as “interest.” (When you deposit money in a savings account, the bank pays you interest. But when you borrow money from the bank, you pay interest to the bank.) The amount of interest on credit is usually considerably higher than the interest paid by a financial institution on savings accounts. This is one way that banks and other financial institutions make money. 
The interest rate on loans is expressed as an annual percentage rate, or APR. The APR is the yearly cost of a loan stated as a percentage of the loan amount. It reflects the interest rate and other fees required to make the loan. 
Using a credit card is like getting a short-term loan from a bank. If you pay back the full amount you spend each month, the bank will not charge you interest, and the credit card is merely a convenient tool to use. However, if you do not pay the full amount each month, the bank will charge you interest on the unpaid portion, and this can get very costly!",B1,"{'title': 'text_157.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Credit Cards \nAt age 21, you may be able to have a credit card in your own name.

"Title: Death Penalty - for or against? 
 
Death penalty is definitely nonsensical. Nowadays we notice a rapid deacrese in inflicting capital punishment, which is indicative of the general loss of belief in its purposefulness. The fact that death penalty ceases to be popular is caused by a hightened awarness of the value of human life. After so terrible experiences as the two world wars we seem to be more cautious and hesitant when considering taking man s life .
The strongest argument that can be levelled against death penalty is its inhumanity. Unlike other punishmenys, this does not have any educational function, at least for the convict. The only, though very doubtful, value of capital punishment is its role as the deterrent of potential criminals who premeditate committing a crime, a murder in this case. Thus the significance of the punishment, if we assume that punishment can bring any positive results, is shihted from the individual to society. The individual is sentenced to death penalty not to be prevented from committing further crimes but to threaten the community against repeating his grave mistake. Yet, as we fortunately managed to observe, killing the murderers have never been a successful method of getting rid of them. Quite the opposite, cruel laws always produced ruthless and insensitive people who, living under harsh rule themselves, disregarded the universal and undeniable value of human life. Severe laws do not educate society but deprive people of their intrinsic moral sense, and thus create a vicious circle .
Crime cannot be eradicated by laws because they do not concern the motives but the effects of offensive behaviour. Although for society it is much easier to threaten individuals than to promote humanistic values, we should not limit our efforts in crime prevention to mere negative measures, but we should also try to positively influence the system which gives birth to criminals .
It should be considered whether killing, or to state it more eupheministically, liquidating murderers, deserves to be called a fair punishment. When a murder has been committed and the murderer is in the hands of justice, he is no longer dangerous to anyone. Closed in a prison cell, he is completely defenceless and helpless, even if he realizes his mistake and repends it. He is not given a chance to make any resolutions. He cannot make amends. Thus if we kill such a person, we are not better than he and our killing is as ruthless as his. Accordingly, executing a capital punishment on a helpless person is tantamount to a premeditated murder .
Still, assuming that death penalty is an appropriate punishment for murderers, we can never be sure what motives underlied the crime, whether it was premeditated or accidental, or whether it was committed consciously or in a state of irresponsibility. The evidence is often too vague or even contradictory, which does not conduce to impartial judgement. Insisting on justice, we can easily make a fatal and irreversible mistake sentencing to death an innocent person .
Finally, we can question our right to put ourselves in the position of masters of life and death. Life, especially human life, is still a great mystery to us. Man is not capable of fathoming this mystery and creating life on his own. Therefore, being completely ignorant of the origin and aim of life, he should not destroy it .",C2,"{'title': '381_POSI1010.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Death Penalty - for or against? \n \nDeath penalty is definitely nonsensical.

"A NEW LIFE
The Farmer
Matt Froggatt used to be an insurance agent in the City of London but now runs a sheep farm.
'After 14 years in business, I found that the City had gone from a place which was exciting to work in to a grind - no one was having fun any more. But I hadn't planned to leave for another five or ten years when I was made redundant. It came out of the blue. I didn't get a particularly good pay-off but it was enough to set up the farm with. My break came when I got to know the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 hotel restaurants in the country. Through supplying them, my reputation spread and now I also supply meat through mail order. I'm glad
I'm no longer stuck in the office but it's astonishing how little things have changed for me: the same 80- to 90-hour week and still selling a product.'
The Painter
Ron Able white was a manager in advertising but now makes a living as an artist.
'My painting began as a hobby but I realised I was getting far more excitement out of it than out of working. The decision to take redundancy and to become an artist seemed logical. The career counsellor I talked to was very helpful. I think I was the first person who had ever told him, ""I don't want to go back to where I've been."" He was astonished because the majority of people in their mid-forties need to get back to work immediately- they need the money. But we had married young and our children didn't need our support. It was a leap into the unknown. We went to the north of England, where we didn't know a soul. It meant leaving all our friends, but we've been lucky in that our friendships have survived the distance - plenty of them come up and visit us now.'
The Haymaker
After working for five years asa company lawyer, Katherine Goodison set up her own business in her London flat, making hats for private clients.
'My job as a lawyer was fun. It was stimulating and I earned a lot of money, but the hours were terrible. I realised I didn't want to become a senior partner in the company, working more and more hours, so I left. A lot of people said I'd get bored, but that has never happened. The secret is to have deadlines. Since it's a fashion-related business,you have the collections, next year's shapes,the season-there's always too much to do, so you have to run a very regimented diary. I feel happier now, and definitely less stressed. There are things I really long for, though, like the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I'm totally responsible for the product. If I do a rubbish job, then I'm the one who takes the blame. Of course, you care when you're working for a company, but when your name is all over the promotional material, you care that little bit more.'
The Masseur
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London.
'I had been in financial markets from the age of 22, setting up deals. I liked the adrenaline but I never found the work rewarding. I was nearly made redundant in 1989, but I escaped by resigning and travelling for a year. I spent that year trying to work out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the world's best gymnasiums and talked to the owners about how they started up. I knew that to change career I had to get qualifications so I did various courses in massage.Then I was offered part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets.

"Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
I totally go against the above given statement that dreaming and imagination is minimized in modern and advanced technological world of today. Rather according to my opinion, imagination and dreaming has got broad canvass and vision due to numerous 
availability of sources and information. I would like to start my argument with the mostly hold opinion of people about dreaming and imagination that is with the advancement of machinery, scientific researches, the passion of love is reduced to none. That is altogether wrong family is basic unit of society, family ties are there. The natural instinct of human being to love and to be loved is there. What so ever advancement man is doing, where so ever he is reaching, the need of love, sympathy, gernerousity, feelings leads towards dreaming and imagination. Dreams for a better, peaceful, smooth family or social life is there with man and it can never change .
All the advancements are bringing change in his living standards. Man has got luxurious and facilities life to live and enjoy. But we should not forget here to mention that all these progresses are actually the result of dreaming and imagination alongwith hard work and experinents to improve the standards of life. Another angle of that can be taken or interpreted for this statement is that of time consumption. It is said that people are much occupied with scientific facts and technological achievements that he is never free for dreams. They said that dreams are needed if one is unable to get what one wants. If everything is available, everything is on finger touch, then there does seem any place for imagination. But the things that are available on finger touch are not all life .
These are an important aspect of life, not all life can be spent depending on these things. If one makes the use of technology excessively in one's life, there surely comes a time when his/her nerves get faliqued and one needs that imaginative part of one's life back .
Dreaming and imagination is essential human activity which controls him from becoming mechenical brutal and inhumar. Being mechanical can not support a man to fit in society, neither it helps a man to live healthily and happily. Dreaming points to future, which imagination points to both past and future. Man tried his level best to do his best to get best in life. Along with doing best, he keeps on dreaming for more and more to compete and beat others for making his life superior but there comes a moment when he imagins his past when he started struggle then he sees his future to be more bright and envious for others. He wishes his family, country to be more successful and excel in every walk of life. He dreams to get fame in case of success. So it is proved that scientific achievement in shape of technological advancement is not all for satisfaction of man, dreaming is has the half share with these things Dreaming and imagination is a kind of Recluse for relaxation from all mental and physical effort. It is actually a key to the physical achievement. One dreams of some thing and then one uses ones mind to make that thought a reality. The same is case with imagination. One imagines something better to accur in life and tries that imagination be reality. We can see the collapse of many societies, who eradicate these things for their life and the result was collapse of society and a robote like life. So it create a balance in society, both things need to walk side byside .
Dreaming is innate in man which can never be irradicated, neither there modern era is able to caste off there things from life.

Ivan was born on a farm in Russia, but from the age of twelve to eighteen he studied in Poland. His first music teacher couldn't play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from the opera. His mother began to teach him the piano when he was six. At ten, he decided that he wanted to write music too, and he soon started on his first song.
Oleg Gagarin
Oleg was the youngest of five children and when he was four years old his father, who liked playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. When he was six, he started having lessons with a piano teacher who lived in the same city. Oleg soon began to win prizes for his piano playing. At the age of fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years. Later, he returned home to Russia.

"The Schoolgirl Model

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not flying off to wonderful locations and appearing on the covers of magazines, you'll probably find her revising for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw finds out more. 

'I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,' the receptionist at the agency told me. 'Oh, fine,' I said, 'no problem.' I had been trying to convince myself that all the bad things I had read about models were rubbish, but the words difficult, vain and unintelligent kept coming into my head. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she had decided a visit to the hairdresser's would be more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she would be rushing. She could be in an awful mood and refuse to answer my questions. 
But when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed and apologetic and with her mother. Kira was not dressed in expensive-looking designer clothes but in a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude, she was just a very friendly, very tall, very pretty girl. All models under the age of 16 must take an adult with them whenever they work, she explained, and apart from looking incredibly young, her mother was a normal mum - visibly proud of her successful daughter. 
Kira gives the impression of being slightly puzzled by her new-found fame, which is understandable since it was completely unplanned. It was her older sister who decided that she should take part in the model competition. 'She saw the competition and said I should go in for it,' Kira remembers. 'I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway.' When the call came to tell her that she was a finalist, she was at school. 
The achievement of being selected for the final [line 38: beginning] gave Kira the confidence to go through with it and [line 38: end] she performed perfectly. She won easily and the Select model agency in London immediately offered her work. 
Kira now finds that one of the hardest things she has to do is to manage her two separate lives. But her friends and teachers have become accustomed to having a star among them. 'They're really proud of me,' she says. However, a few unkind people at her school are rude about her success. 'They say I have too high an opinion of myself.' This kind of remark must be hard for Kira to deal with, since there can't be many people as successful as her who are less self-important. But she says, 'They assume that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that's changed is I've become more confident - not in a horrible way, but I'm able to stand up for myself more.' 
As a busy model though, her social life is obviously affected. The Select agency can ring at any time and tell her that she is wanted for a job the next day. 'If my friends are going out together, I can't say I'll come, because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do they sometimes get broken, but my friends are good about it. They don't say, ""Oh, you're always going off modelling now, you never have time for us"".' 
Kira has the looks, ability and support to have a fabulous career ahead of her. And not many people can say that before they even sit their school-leaving exams. I am about to finish the interview with the girl who has it all, and I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the outstanding beauty that seems certain to take her to the top of the profession. She pauses and replies: 'I'd like to do what you're doing.'",B2,"{'title': '62.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'The Schoolgirl Model\n\nWhen 15-year-old Kira Langer is not flying off to wonderful locations and appearing on the covers of magazines, you\'ll probably find her revising for her school exams.

"If there is one thing that unites almost the whole population of Canada, it is the experience of winter.
    While in most parts of Europe, people never know what the winter weather will be like from one week to the next, Canadians know what winter means. When the last leaves fall off the trees in Autumn, Canadians know that the winter is coming, and that it will be cold; or if it is not cold, it will be very cold! When the Arctic air blows south in the winter months, Canadians know that the temperature will fall to -20° or lower, perhaps down to -40°; but because they know that it is going to happen, Canadians are ready for it! That, as they say, is half the battle of survival!
    In Edmonton, the biggest city in the province of Alberta, the first winter snows can come in October.  When this happens, Edmontonians complain that it is a bit early, but then just got on with normal life.
     For most of the winter, which usually lasts from November to April, daytime temperatures in the city rarely rise above freezing; from time to time, Arctic winds howl down from the north, and for several days temperatures in the city may not rise above -20° (and may drop below -40°).

Canadians have to know how to cope with the cold; those who can\'t have just two options, to emigrate or to go and live beyond the Rocky Mountains, beside the Pacific Ocean, in ""B.C.""  – British Columbia!\n    The easiest way to keep away from the cold of a Canadian winter is to stay indoors as much as possible! \n'}"

"Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
If people are asked what the most important thing in life is, most of them give the same answer: money! The response to the question what their aim in life is, is somewhat different: happiness. Here, one might think, ""where is here the similarity?"" 
The answers are similar, in that for most people happiness depends upon money. In a way this is not very surprising, as generally happiness is received through power, comfort, pride, and popularity .
First of all, to achieve these aims a lot of people are ready to make a hard and merciless journey through life tasting the bitterness of ambition, fraud, jealousy and lies, which in this case seems very sweet to them. It is obvious that all these features have negative associations. But how can a person leave the fingers from money when you can not even make a step without it? 
Secondly, some people just want to make so much money as to stay alive. Therefore they are ready to work hard, and sometimes this readiness turns to unconsciousness. People forget their real aim in life and being unaware of it they glide in to a vicious circle without an escape...
A next issue to be taken to consideration is need. There are a lot of people in the world who do not even find a piece of bread to stop their hunger. What shall these people do if they can not find a job to work in and if the government do not have the power and organization to support them? It is a fact that these people do not think of the moral aspects of their decision. These people find an only way for solution, and this is theft! 
As a result, it can be said that the proverb ""Money is the root of all devil"" in the original meaning of the word is right. However, it depends on the propriety of its use .
If people are after money just because they can not get enough, and if they lose control over themselves then the devil is at work. And in most cases stopping this devil is nearly impossible. The more money is earned or ""not earned"", the more is wanted by people. It is just the ambiguity that awakes the devil, not the money itself. And this ambiguity is created by people, not the money. In the business to make as much money as soon as possible, people forget their real aims in their lives and suddenly they find themselves in a competition against the whole world. The will to be better than the others, to have a more luxury life, to own the most expensive things and thus to be more powerful than the others, leads people who are not able to keep their limits to deeds that are not well - seen in the society. But as long as every individual knows his or her limits and do not lose the control over his or her life, money will just serve for peoples' advantages .",B2,"{'title': '462_TRCU1046.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: In the words of the old song: \'Money is the root of all evil\' \n \nIf people are asked what the most important thing in life is, most of them give the same answer: money!

"Title: Should the death penalty be abolished? 
 
 [Quotation] [Reference] . This definition does clarify the meaning of the phrase ""capital punishment"" but it does not provide any justification for the use of the death penalty. It seems to me that asking ""what"" capital punishment is is not as important as the question ""why"" it is still in use. In many countries all over the world hell is still being raised over the controversial question whether death penalty should be abolished or not .

[Reference] Many western European societies seem to have realized that the texts of the bible are outdated. Since the age of the Enlightenment the death sentence has been highly critizised. Although this kind of punishment was controversial since the 18th century, many countries abolished the death sentence only a few years ago. The Federal Republic of Germany for example abolished capital punishment in 1949 whereas former East Germany used this kind of punishment up to the reunion of east and west in 1989. The Austrian government, which used to carry out the death sentences by hanging, decided in 1919 not to use death penalty anymore. So did Switzerland in 1937. France, which had many spectacular beheadings, only abolished the death penalty in 1981. The United States government also decided to abolish death penalty in 1972, but unfortunately, some states of the Union reestablished capital punishment in 1976 and still use it today (cf. Brockhuas) 1961 the British lawyer Peter Benenson founded Amnesty International (ai). The organization aims to help prisoners who were arrested for religious, racial or ethical reasons, provided they did not approve of or use violence. Every year ai members plead for the release of about 5000 prisoners. The organization holds conferences and initiates actions against the violation of human rights. There is a high demand for organizations like ai as the high number of executions in 1984 sadly documents . 1125 verifiable executions in 44 countries worldwide seem to be a cry for help. ai was awarded the Nobel peach price in 1977.

The Afro-American Edward Earl Johnson was sentenced to death by a jury in Louisiana for murdering a white women. The verdict was based only on the statement which Johnson had given under the pressure of policemen forcing him to repeat their words at pistol point. Although his family and his lawyer appealed to the Supreme Court several times, Edward E. Johnson was executed in the early eighties after spending only a comparatively short period of time on death row. According to Amnesty International, Mr Johnson is the 24th innocent individual since 1961 who was executed .
In the United States there is a steady increase in the number of criminal actions. Therefore the need for solutions is crucial. The President of the country, Bill Clinton, and his staff developed a bill which is currently discussed in congress.

"Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
Crime is an act committed by somebody which is against the laws of a society and harmful for the people of the society. Whenever somebody committs a crime, he is supposed to be guilty and is supposed to be punished for his act, so that he and the other members of the society learn the lesson from his punishment. Now, it is the duty of the law enforcing agencies and the members of the civil society to make a code of conduct which should be applied to each and every member of the society . 
There are different code of conducts and different punishment procedures in different societies. For example, the punishment for theft is different in different societies. Prison is the place where the criminals are detained to segregate them from the rest of the people so that they may not cause harm to the members of the society and the members of the society may live in a peaceful way. So prison is a place where criminals are kept. It is a place where criminals are kept as a result of their guilt for a period of time sufficient enough to make them clear of the guilt. So prison is a place which plays very important role in the later life of a criminal when he is released from the prison. During his stay in the prison he has to live with the other criminals who are detained for different crimes some more severe some of moderate intensity, so a criminal lives in a sort of school or a hostel or home where he lives and interacts with other people. It makes the prison a society . 
There are children who are detained for their guilt e.g. pick pocketing, there are persons who are detained for major wrong doings e.g a theft or a murder but as they live together in prison they interact with each other so they have a chance to learn from each other and from the environment of the prison. In most of the civilized societies the prisons are thought to be an important place and are given good importance to make them a proper learning place and beneficial for the criminals. They are given psychological consultations to help them resolve their mental sickness. They are taught different subjects which help them in their later life to make them good citizens. Prisons are made a good vocational institutes where criminals learn alot. In third world countries, and poor countries like Pakistan, prisons are still a place which needs a lot of reforms . 
Rather than turning a guilty person or criminal into a good citizen, the environment of prison makes these prisons more harmful for the society. In their after release life they become more dangerous of the rest of the society members or they learn alot more ways to commit crimes and cause harm to the society.

"Young Masters

Age is against Bobby Fischer as he seeks again to re-establish himself. Chess is more than ever a young man's game.

After 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer's victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. Mr Spassky is even older.
Chess has also changed a lot over the past two decades. A new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer's own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The sole aim of the modern master is to win.
In international chess, a player's nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense: a chess clock is used to ensure that each player completes the stipulated number of moves in the allotted time - failure to do so results in immediate loss of the game. But now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth's favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. It is significant that, of the world's ten highest-ranked players, eight are under 30.
Nor is it only the way the game is played that has changed. Much of modern chess is played off the board - and not just the battle for psychological advantage that Mr Fischer wages so well. Every professional must now take seriously his pre-match preparation, not least because the age of computer databases has had a profound impact on chess. A small portable computer can hold one million chess games, and give instant access to hundreds of games of a prospective opponent.
In one recent contest, each of the protagonists employed large teams of assistants to work round the clock searching for flaws in the other's repertoire. The opening stages of a chess game are now analysed to near exhaustion. Simply being better prepared in chess opening can be the deciding factor in the game.
The chess world today boasts more first-rate players than at any stage in its history. Hundreds of grandmasters chase modest prize money the world over. Success demands physical as well as mental exertion. A single game may last up to eight hours. For the chess master this period represents a ceaseless struggle. A lapse in concentration can mean disaster. So the adversaries are always in a state of nervous tension.
The presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious 'time scramble'. When this occurs, each player has only seconds to make several moves or face instant forfeiture. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire. Such moments are not for reflective intellectuals. The game descends into a primeval struggle in which nerves, tenacity and an overwhelming will to win separate victor from vanquished.
At the top level of chess, the pain of losing is unbearable. Winning brings immense satisfaction and a chance to recover from the nerves and exhaustion. But one victory is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready for the struggle the next day. Most chess competitions last for 9-11 days, with play on every day, and there is an all-year-round tournament circuit. World championship matches are even more exacting. The 1984 encounter between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be aborted after several months on the grounds of mutual exhaustion. Mr Karpov had shed around two stone (10kg) in weight.
Can Mr Fischer defy these odds? He once declared ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess.""
This sentiment made his exodus from the chess world after 1972 seem even more inexplicable. But in some respects it was a fitting end to his story. It immortalised Bobby Fischer.
If he has come back for the money, he is onto a good thing. Whatever happens in his match with Mr Spassky, each will end up several million dollars richer.

Chess is more than ever a young man\'s game.\n\nAfter 20 years of self-imposed exile, Mr Bobby Fischer has returned to chess and is playing his old adversary Boris Spassky. Mr Fischer\'s victory in the first game was a masterpiece, simple but profound. But, as subsequent games have shown, this balding, bearded chess player is not the man of 1972. He is 49 years old, out of practice and out of shape. Mr Spassky is even older.\nChess has also changed a lot over the past two decades. A new era of professionalism was born out of Mr Fischer\'s own popularisation of the game. The rise of the professional chess circuit has seen the competitive aspect of the game overtake the scientific and artistic. The sole aim of the modern master is to win.\nIn international chess, a player\'s nerves and stamina are as crucial as his intellect and wisdom. The pressure of the game has always been intense: a chess clock is used to ensure that each player completes the stipulated number of moves in the allotted time - failure to do so results in immediate loss of the game. But now the playing sessions themselves are becoming longer, and many games are played without a break. The increased pressure has swung the pendulum in youth\'s favour. Over the past 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than his predecessor. It is significant that, of the world\'s ten highest-ranked players, eight are under 30.\nNor is it only the way the game is played that has changed. Much of modern chess is played off the board - and not just the battle for psychological advantage that Mr Fischer wages so well. Every professional must now take seriously his pre-match preparation, not least because the age of computer databases has had a profound impact on chess. A small portable computer can hold one million chess games, and give instant access to hundreds of games of a prospective opponent.\nIn one recent contest, each of the protagonists employed large teams of assistants to work round the clock searching for flaws in the other\'s repertoire. The opening stages of a chess game are now analysed to near exhaustion. Simply being better prepared in chess opening can be the deciding factor in the game.\nThe chess world today boasts more first-rate players than at any stage in its history. Hundreds of grandmasters chase modest prize money the world over. Success demands physical as well as mental exertion. A single game may last up to eight hours. For the chess master this period represents a ceaseless struggle. A lapse in concentration can mean disaster. So the adversaries are always in a state of nervous tension.\nThe presence of the chess clock adds to the tension. The climax of the game is often a furious \'time scramble\'. When this occurs, each player has only seconds to make several moves or face instant forfeiture. With minds racing and hands twitching, the masters blitz out their moves and press their clocks with a co-ordination that any athlete would admire. Such moments are not for reflective intellectuals. The game descends into a primeval struggle in which nerves, tenacity and an overwhelming will to win separate victor from vanquished.\nAt the top level of chess, the pain of losing is unbearable. Winning brings immense satisfaction and a chance to recover from the nerves and exhaustion. But one victory is not enough to win a tournament. The chess master must be ready for the struggle the next day. Most chess competitions last for 9-11 days, with play on every day, and there is an all-year-round tournament circuit.

"Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Religion had, and still has, a great impact on our society. Religion was once part of a guidence which led to our Constitution in 1814. Still, today, the ten commandments are also seen in the Constitution as well .
Similarily, media, and especially television, is another arena in which different views are presented and popularised. Television is performing a kind of social control in keeping the masses ordered, just like religion once did. It generally act to reinforce values that are part of the whole society and plays an important role in the matter of forming new laws. The law concerning children-porn is just one example. If it wasn't for the media, this discussion might not have come up. Like religion, television affect how people think, believe and behave. Some might proclaim that this will destroy people's self awareness. But unlike from religion, people in today's society are rational beeings with the oppurtunity to choose. They can even choose not to have a telly in the house at all. That is the difference between television and religion. You can't choose religion. You are born into it. This is what really create conflicts, e.g schoolchildren shot on their way to school in because of their religion .
So the statement that television is the opium of the masses, connote negative reactions. We automatically think of the new television-culture nowadays; reality programs. Because of our quriosity which lies lateny in human nature, this sort of entertaining, will for a long period of time make the reader addicted .
In addition to pure entertaining, television contributes on other arenas as well. It's important to have access to information about real violence and sexuality in the world. Restricting such can be socially and politically repressive. Eg. The Vietnam War .
Religion gathered people. They went to church, they still do, and prayed together. They came to terms with their feelings and could escape from the real world within common surroundings. If we replace religion with television in the 20th century, we will witness the same thing. TV is both entertaining and reality. Still, it's an another world. We are consumers in a television-world so to speak. But as people were sceptic to religion in earlier days, the scepticism within television must not be unmentioned either. We have to remember that media in itself not only reflect events. They construct and change them as well. Television cannot mirror or reflect real-life situation innocently, since they become part of the events themselves. This is also a financial matter. Most producers know how to make the mass addicted. People's support concerning The Royal Wedding were among other events broadcastet all over the world. We could see how small children were dressed up with flags and tiaras. The Wedding produced some kind of emotional response in us. Weeks after, people were still talking about it. Some even recorded it . I think I'm addicted, a lady once said. She just had to watch it over and over again .
Religion bonded people together, television creates the same formula in todays' society. Over the years, TV has become a global village, were interactions and belonging are central elements. An escape from reality, but still give us insight of it, are reasons enough why television is opium for the masses. At least for most of them .",B2,"{'title': '336_NOHO1035.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses.

"Our governmental system at both the national and state levels is based on the principle of representation. People do not themselves govern, nor do they ordinarily vote to adopt laws and public policy. Rather, they govern indirectly by electing legislators to represent them. 
For the framers of the U.S. Constitution, the legitimacy of the government came from the consent of the governed. The House of Representatives, with its members elected by specific geographical areas throughout the nation, was designed to reflect the views of the people. The Senate, with its members originally selected by state legislatures, was designed to reflect the sovereignty of the states. The will of the people would find its way through legislative chambers by means of lawmakers who would assess the preferences and interests of the people they represent and take them into account in deciding on matters of public policy.

"Young Shoppers
Supermarket shopping with children, one mother says, is absolute murder: 'They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugar- coated breakfast cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually all three. I can't afford all this stuff and, anyway, if I agree to their demands I feel I've been persuaded against my better judgement and I feel guilty about buying and feeding them rubbish. Yet I hate myself for saying no all the time, and I get cross and defensive in anticipation as we leave home. I do my best to avoid taking them shopping but then I worry that I'm not allowing them to have the experience they need in order to make their own choices. I can't win.'
Research has found that children taken on a supermarket trip make a purchase request every two minutes. More than PS150 million a year is now spent on advertising directly to children, most of it on television. That figure is likely to increase and it is in the supermarket aisles that the investment is most likely to be successful. For children, the reasons behind their parents' decisions about what they can and cannot afford are often unclear, and arguments about how bad sugar is for your teeth are unconvincing when compared with the attractive and emotionally persuasive advertising campaigns.
According to Susan Dibb of the National Food Alliance, 'Most parents are concerned about what they give their children to eat and have ideas about what food is healthy - although those ideas are not always accurate. Obviously, such a dialogue between parents and children is a good thing, because if the only information children are getting about products is from TV advertising, they are getting a very one-sided view. Parents resent the fact that they are competing with the advertising industry and are forced into the position of repeatedly disappointing their children.' The Independent Television Commission, which regulates TV advertising, prohibits advertisers from telling children to ask their parents to buy products. But, as Dibb points out, 'The whole purpose of advertising is to persuade the viewer to buy something. So even if they cannot say, ""Tell your mum to buy this product,"" the intended effect is precisely that.'
A major source of stress for some parents shopping with children is the mental energy required to decide which demands should be agreed to and which should be refused. One mother says she has patience when it comes to discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about the way she manages their shopping demands: 'My son does pay attention to advertisements but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and spend time looking at labels. I've talked about it so much that I've brainwashed him into thinking all adverts are rubbish. We have very little conflict in the supermarket now because the children don't ask for things I won't want to buy.'
Parents also admit they are inconsistent, even hypocritical, in their responses to their children's purchasing requests. Mike, father of a son of seven and a daughter of three, says, 'We refuse to buy him the sweets he wants on the grounds that it's bad for him while we are busy loading the trolley with double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It's enjoyable to buy nice things, and it's quite reasonable that children should want to share that, I suppose. But I still find myself being irritated by their demands. It partly depends on how I feel. If I'm feeling generous and things are going well in my life, I'm more likely to say yes. It's hard to be consistent.'
Supermarkets themselves could do a lot more to ease parent-child conflict by removing sweets from checkout areas or even by providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less because their children are not with them, the thought of shopping without your six-year-old's demands would surely attract enough extra customers to more than make up the difference.",B2,"{'title': '32.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Young Shoppers\nSupermarket shopping with children, one mother says, is absolute murder: \'They want everything they see.

"Margaret and her liquid assets
Margaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense'. She can hold a forked hazel rod above the ground and detect water. She is increasingly in demand by farmers whose wells have dried up.
Together with her husband, Margaret Wilkins runs a well-drilling business, using technology such as drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. But when it comes to locating water, she needs nothing more than a forked hazel stick. The couple's success rate is higher than 90 per cent. Dowsing - the ability to locate water, minerals and lost objects underground - is a so-called 'sixth sense'. There are many theories about how it is done, ranging from the physical, such as magnetism, to the spiritual. One of the most credible is based on the knowledge that everything on this planet vibrates, water more than other matter. It is suggested that dowsers have an acute ability to sense vibrations while standing on the Earth's surface; some dowsers say that they can 'sense' water, others that they can smell it, smell being the most acute sense.
For the Wilkins, the drought years of recent times have been busy, with an almost six-week-long waiting list at one stage. Most of Margaret's customers are farmers with wells that have dried up: 'We will see customers only once in a lifetime because wells last for a long time.' Other customers own remote cottages or barns, now holiday homes, where the expense of running water pipes for great distances is prohibitive. Others are golf-course developers with clubhouse facilities to build.
Margaret tries to locate water between 50 and 70 metres down. 'You can't drill a well where there is the slightest risk of farm or other waste getting into the water supply. The water we locate is running in fissures of impervious rock and, as long as we bring the water straight up, it should give a good clean supply, though Cornwall is rich in minerals so you have to watch out for iron.'
Another necessity is electricity to drive the pump; this is too expensive to run across miles of fields so ideally the well should be near to existing power supplies.
After considering all this, Margaret can start to look for water. On large areas, such as golf courses, she begins with a map of the area and a pendulum. 'I hold the pendulum still and gently move it over the map. It will swing when it is suspended over an area where there is water.'
After the map has indicated likely areas, Margaret walks over the fields with a hazel stick, forked and equal in length and width each side. 'Once I'm above water I get a peculiar feeling; I reel slightly. When it subsides I use the stick to locate the exact spot where we should drill.' Gripping the two forks of the stick with both hands, she eases them outwards slightly to give tension. 'When water is immediately below, the straight part of the stick rises up. It's vital to drill exactly where the stick says. A fraction the wrong way, and you can miss the waterline altogether. My husband will dowse the same area as me; usually, not always, we agree on the precise place to drill. If we disagree, we won't drill and will keep looking until we do agree.'
Margaret Wilkins is not in isolation, carrying out some curious old tradition down in the west of England. Anthropologists and writers have long been fascinated by this inexplicable intuition. Margaret calls it an 'intuitive perception of the environment' and that is the closest we can get to understanding why she locates water so accurately. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', how else could the family live off their well-drilling business year after year?",C1,"{'title': '56.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Margaret and her liquid assets\nMargaret Wilkins is said to have a 'sixth sense'.

"ICE SKATING 

Ice skating has a history of thousands of years. Archaeologists have discovered skates made from animal bone. It seems that bone skates were used until the introduction of iron into Scandinavia about the year 200 AD. Among the Scandinavian upper classes, skating was seen as an essential skill. 
In the early twentieth century, skating was stylish and reserved, but at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11- year-old Sonja Henie introduced a more athletic attitude which inspired a new wave of popularity. Nowadays art and athletics are combined and modern skating is both graceful and physically demanding. 
For the beginner, balance and control are all important and speed can only increase with proficiency. The position of your body plays a great part in balance. Legs slightly bowed and the knees bent keep the body weight centred; in effect the body leans slightly forward in this position. For skating, probably more than any other sport or recreation, relaxation is vital.
For the starting position, the heels should almost be touching and the feet should be turned outwards. While pushing forward with the back foot, you make a very small movement with the other foot. Fairly easy, isn't it? If you can keep this up for a while, you can then slowly increase the length of your movements as you gain experience. 
Knowing how to fall must be learnt among the skater's first skills. Even the best of the professionals fall. In order to fall without injury, you should be as relaxed as possible. In this way the shock of hitting the ice is lessened. To get up, use your hands to get into a kneeling position, then stand. 
Once you have learnt to move on the ice with confidence, there are various styles to be practised - figure skating, free style, distance, speed, skating in pairs, and so on - but the basis of them all, and by far the best approach, is first to learn figure skating and then elementary freestyle. With proper guidance available at most of the ice rinks throughout the country, the basic figures can soon be learnt and the turns, jumps and spins of elementary free style will soon follow. 
If you look at any good or professional skater, you will see how relaxed they are and how easily they move. To achieve this an exercise programme should be regularly practised. It can be dangerous to skate with a stiff body and warm-up exercises should at least include those for the legs, back and shoulders, with special emphasis on the ankles and the knees. After a long or intense session, the same exercises should be used afterwards to avoid stiffness. 
Skating improves balance, co-ordination, relaxation and movement. It improves heart and lung activity and generally strengthens the body. Combined with swimming or jogging, it provides a great programme for all-round health and fitness.",B2,"{'title': '45.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""ICE SKATING \n\nIce skating has a history of thousands of years.

"'You don't take sugar, do you? shouted his secretary, not so much asking a question as stating a fact - as well she might, because she had been making Lancelot cups of coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting such things was that he wasn't normally supposed to be there. Actually nowadays he was usually there all the time, having discovered that to take up his proprietorial privilege of staying away was tantamount to opening the floodgates. Not for the first time he pondered the easy, imperceptibly divided stages by which he had progressed from valued counsellor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch at carefully planned planning meetings complete with agenda, to hapless dogsbody moving one step ahead of catastrophe, with nowhere to park when he arrived at work in the mornings.
'This came,' she yelled, vaguely waving a manila folder before putting it down in front of him. 'From that chap in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it.' A typed label said: 'A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert.' Just under that it said 'An Expanded Synopsis'. Lancelot did not want to see that word 'synopsis'. At the very least he wanted to see a label saying 'A First Draft'. Lancelot had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not really want to see another, however heavily revised. Ian Cuthbert had been given an advance of several thousands of pounds for this book during the initial flurry of activity when Lancelot had bought the firm. One of several old friends from whom Lancelot had made the capital error of commissioning books, Ian Cuthbert was a particularly flagrant proof that in such circumstances the possessor of a wayward temperament, far from nerving himself to behave more predictably for friendship's sake, will actually become less 'pindownable' than ever.
Lancelot skipped the blurb come preamble which he had read for what seemed like the hundredth time and sampled the synopsis proper. There was scarcely a phrase that he did not recognise at a glance. He closed the folder and shifted it to one side. Plainly at this rate Ian's manuscript would never be forthcoming. As well as almost wholly lacking the brilliance for which its author was supposed to be famous, the synopsis, under its doggedly frolicsome tone, had the unmistakable dead ring of a lost conviction. Lancelot remembered tales of a famous author-about-town whose last book, published incomplete after his death, had been coaxed from him chapter by chapter, one payment at a time. But in that case, the payments were fractions of a hypothetical advance which had never been given in the first place. Ian's advance had been enormous; a blatant reversal of the sound business principle by which authors must deliver a manuscript now in order to be paid with inflated currency later.
Lancelot, who had read modern languages at Oxford, could remember the day when Ian Cuthbert had been the most promising talent in a Cambridge so full of promise that it had made everywhere else feel provincial. Ian's contemporaries had plotted to take over the British theatre and in a remarkably short time they had actually done so. But their mental energy had seemed like indolence when you looked at Ian. He had worn his overcoat like a cape and talked about what one very famous French writer had said as if he had been there to overhear it. Yet for some reason, the whole frostily coruscating galaxy of Ian's creative intellect had remained locked in its closet. While less gifted deviants came out and conquered, Ian went further in. At the height of his influence as a literary taste-maker he was already notoriously difficult to deal with. Officially appointed by the relevant public agency to edit a comprehensive magazine of the arts, he was like a general with a million tons of equipment pinned down on the beach by nothing except an excess of opportunity. The magazine used up the budget for a dozen issues without appearing once. Similarly, his thrice-renewed three-year contract with one of the fashion magazines engendered little except legends about the size of his emolument, which was increased from generosity to extravagance in an attempt to make him produce more, and then from extravagance to munificence in an attempt to make him produce anything. At the editorial working breakfasts - there were always at least two of the titled photographers present to capture the scene for posterity - Ian spat witty venom through clenched teeth, and poured nitric acid on other people's ideas. Ten years later, he could scarcely be depended upon to turn up for his own funeral.

Her excuse for forgetting such things was that he wasn't normally supposed to be there. Actually nowadays he was usually there all the time, having discovered that to take up his proprietorial privilege of staying away was tantamount to opening the floodgates. Not for the first time he pondered the easy, imperceptibly divided stages by which he had progressed from valued counsellor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch at carefully planned planning meetings complete with agenda, to hapless dogsbody moving one step ahead of catastrophe, with nowhere to park when he arrived at work in the mornings.\n'This came,' she yelled, vaguely waving a manila folder before putting it down in front of him. 'From that chap in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it.' A typed label said: 'A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert.' Just under that it said 'An Expanded Synopsis'. Lancelot did not want to see that word 'synopsis'. At the very least he wanted to see a label saying 'A First Draft'.

"Einstein

Stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, and the chances are they'll think of Albert Einstein. His face is used to advertise products with intellectual connotations, from computers to encyclopaedias.
Most people know little of what Einstein did, except that he developed some mysterious theories under the heading 'relativity', which are famous for being incomprehensible, and for coming up with bizarre predictions that run counter to everyday experience.
Einstein was part of a gigantic leap forward in scientific thinking, an intellectual revolution that heralded the birth of twentieth century science. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, more rational description of the universe by studying relationships between matter and the forces of nature.
Einstein made his profound and far-reaching contributions simply by looking again at the nature of the fundamentals: time, space, matter and energy. Previous descriptions had depended on Isaac Newton's view of a universe in which stars and planets moved in an absolute framework of space and time. Einstein overthrew this notion, saying that time and space were not absolute but relative.

Young Readers

Throughout our childhoods, Lydia and I distrusted any prize-winning book because we knew it would be worthy; and for 'worthy', read 'boring', we thought.
While our mother had been inclined to abhor our philistinism in tones of despising innuendo, our father would cheerfully dish us out tenpences, chapter by chapter, as inducements to make us cast our eyes over the occasional improving volume. Or he would slip the odd superior book in amongst our Christmas and birthday presents, labelled in bold marker pen, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Though we dismissed most of his offerings as 'boys' books', he did, in this way, expose us to some shorter works of decent fiction and, just once, to a well-known anthology of verse.

Language

'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous', wrote Jacob Grimm in 1851. The marvellous secret has long proved a launch pad for strange ideas. 'Primitive man was likely to make sounds like ""meuh"" when sensing danger,' claimed Charles Caller in 1928. ""Meuh"" has a plaintive sound. The human who wandered over a hostile land inhabited by awesome beasts uttered desperate noises, and languages have preserved some echo of his lamentation such as malaria meaning ""fever"" or the Latin mors meaning ""death"".
Faced with such weird speculations, many avoided the topic, regarding it as a playground for cranks, but recently, language origin and evolution have become key research areas. Language probably developed in East Africa, around 100,000 years ago. In the main speech was used for friendly interaction, and was an important tool in power struggles. Information-swapping was probably not an important original role - contrary to the views of philosopher John Locke, who spoke of language as a 'great conduit' for conveying knowledge.",C2,"{'title': '33.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Einstein\n\nStop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, and the chances are they\'ll think of Albert Einstein.

"A sheet of rain moved across Placid Cove Trailer Park.
Lightning made a complicated pattern in the night sky. Nudger held his umbrella against the wind as he walked, and pulled a piece of paper from his pocket to check the address of the trailer he was trying to find. Finally, he found Number 307 and knocked on its metal door.
'I'm Nudger,' he said, when the door opened.
The woman in the doorway stared at him. Rain blew in, making wet marks on her pale blue dress and ruffling her blond hair. She was tall but very thin. She looked at first to be about twelve years old, but a second glance showed her to be in her middle twenties. She had blue eyes, a large mouth, and top teeth that rested on her bottom lip when she wasn't talking.
'This rain's terrible,' she said at last, as if seeing beyond Nudger for the first time.
'It is,' Nudger agreed. 'And it's raining on me.'
Her whole body gave a quick, nervous movement as she smiled to apologize. 'I'm Holly Ann Adams, Mr Nudger. And yes, you are getting wet. Come in.'
The trailer was small, and crowded with cheap furniture. Shouts and laughter came from a program on a small black- and-white TV, which was on a tiny table near a worn-out sofa. The air smelled of food which had been fried too long.

"Dave Slatin kept his promises. Things at the shop were good and cheap.
'How does he do it?' asked Mrs Harrison. 'Its winter, but he's selling lots of fruit and vegetables. And they're cheap. I never go to Lidney now.'
The other villagers agreed. The Corner Shop was a success and Dave seemed happy. He paid Anna good wages. Sometimes her friend, Peter, helped at the shop and Dave gave him money too.
Dave advertised in newspapers and the village products sold well. People from Lidney came to The Corner Shop. There were lots of visitors and Woodend became more interesting. The villagers were surprised, but pleased. They were making a lot of money.
Dave lived alone, in a flat above the shop. He was very popular in the village, but no one ever went to his flat. No one ever saw inside it.
At the bottom of the stairs there were two doors. One led into the stockroom. The other door had a notice on it: SPECIAL ORDERS ONLY: KEEP OUT
The door was always locked. Anna never went into the Special Orders room.
'Why do you lock that room, Dave?' Anna asked one day, 'What's in there?'
'It's for special orders,' he replied. 'Big orders.'
'But you won't get any big orders in Woodend,' said Anna.
Dave said nothing. He did not want to talk about that room.
For three months, everything was normal.
Then, one day in April, an unusual customer came into the shop. The new customer was a very beautiful woman. She was wearing expensive clothes and arrived in a large car.

"Title: Do you think that the death penalty should be abolished? 
 
In my opinion, the death penalty should be abolished - the sooner, the better. I cannot believe that this kind of punishment is still tolerated in our - like everybody thinks - modern society. Especially in the USA convicted men and woman are killed by death injections, on the electric chair or in gas chambres, even today. The most illogical thing for me is, that a murderer is condemned to death in one American state and in another he is not .
Now, the question is, why only so few people protest against this punishment, on the contrairy, some citizens even switch on their TV to see, how a convicted person is killed! SO, these people seem to be for the death penalty, but what are their reasons?
I think very important for their opinion is the propaganda by politicians. They often tell us that the death penalty serves as a deterrent. In my opinion this is totally wrong. Every criminal just thinks that he will never be caught and so most of them do not even think of a sentencing in the moment of the criminal act. Anyway, in the Soviet Union, the death penalty has already been abolished, but the crime rate is lower than in the US neverthenless. So, this punishment has nothing to do with deterrent .
Even the worth thing is that the convicted people mostly have to wait for years until they are killed and have no idea when. They cannot ""survive psychically"" if every day could be their last. However, what about the miscarriages of justice? It already happened that innocents have been killed in the name of right and justice. Our guilty conscience can't bring them back to life again!
Just generally spoken: I think that noone has the right to kill anybody, no matter, if the convicted person is a murderer or not. We are living in the twentiest century and the death penalty really reminds me of the time of Hammurabi .
Of course, it is always dangerous that a captive flees, but also that an innocent is killed. And who wants to be responsible for that?
Another reason for the absolition of the death penalty is of course the brutallity of the murderer. If we just think of the electric chair. Sometimes it even lasts ten! minutes until the condemned person is dead. Isn't this a real torture?
The best thing would be that everybody who is affected by the death penalty, can decide for himself, if he wants to be life imprisonment or if he prefers to die soon and fast.

"Solar Survivor

Charles Clover ventures inside Britain’s most environmentally-friendly home.

Southwell in Nottinghamshire is full of surprises. The first is Britain’s least-known ancient cathedral, Southwell Minster, celebrated by writers of an environmental disposition for the pagan figures of ‘green’ men which medieval craftsmen carved into the decoration in its thirteenth-century chapter house. The second, appropriately enough, is Britain’s greenest dwelling, the ‘autonomous house’, designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 
The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into garden compost and heat their house with waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, together with that of their three teenage children and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. You could easily miss the traditional-looking house, roofed with clay pantiles, on a verdant corner plot 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to echo the burnt-orange brick of the town’s nineteenth-century buildings and won approval from the planners even though it is in a conservation area.
Ring the solar-powered doorbell and there is total silence. The house is super-insulated, with krypton-filled triple-glazed windows, which means that you do not hear a sound inside. Once inside and with your shoes off (at Robert’s insistence), there is a monastic stillness. It is a sunny summer’s day, the windows are closed and the conservatory is doing its normal job of warming the air before it ventilates the house. Vale apologises and moves through the house, opening ingenious ventilation shafts and windows. You need to create draughts because draught-proofing is everywhere: even Edison and Faraday have their own air-locked miniature door. 
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, were serious about the environment long before it hit the political agenda. They wrote a book on green architecture back in the 1970s, The Autonomous House. They began by designing a building which emitted no carbon dioxide. Then they got carried away and decided to do without mains water as well. They designed composting earth closets, lowered rainwater tanks into the cellar, and specified copper gutters to protect the drinking water, which they pass through two filters before use. Water from washing runs into the garden (the Vales don’t have a dishwasher because they believe it is morally unacceptable to use strong detergents). Most details have a similar statement in mind. 
‘We wanted people to see that it was possible to design a house which would be far less detrimental to the environment, without having to live in the dark,’ says Robert. ‘It would not be medieval.’ The house’s only medieval aspect is aesthetic: the hall, which includes the hearth and the staircase, rises the full height of the building.
The Vales pay no water bills. And last winter the house used only nine units of electricity a day costing about 70p — which is roughly what other four bedroomed houses use on top of heating. Soon it will use even less, when £20,000 worth of solar water heating panels and generating equipment arrive and are erected in the garden. The house will draw electricity from the mains supply for cooking and running the appliances, but will generate a surplus of electricity. There will even be enough, one day, to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales claim not to use except in the very coldest winter.
So is it warm in winter? One night in February when I happened to call on him, Robert was sitting reading. It was too warm to light the fire, he said. The room temperature on the first floor was 18C, less than the generally expected temperature of living areas, but entirely comfortable, he claimed, because there are no draughts, no radiant heat loss, since everything you touch is at the same temperature. Perceived temperature depends on these factors. An Edwardian lady in the early years of the twentieth century was entirely comfortable at 12.5C, he says, because of the insulation provided by her clothing. Those people who live in pre-1900 housing, he suggests, should simply go back to living as people did then. Somehow, it is difficult to think of this idea catching on. 
The house’s secret is that it is low-tech and there is little to go wrong. Almost everything was obtained from a builder’s merchant and installed by local craftsmen. This made the house cheap to build — it cost the same price per square metre as low-cost housing for rent. Not surprisingly, the commercial building companies are determinedly resisting this idea.",C1,"{'title': 'ba6ae54f-8526-4f00-b9e2-a0e279175712.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Solar Survivor\n\nCharles Clover ventures inside Britain’s most environmentally-friendly home.\n\nSouthwell in Nottinghamshire is full of surprises.

"BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology

'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly, by hand. It is, in other words, not only an agricultural metaphor, it is also one of optimistic modernism. It is about planned growth in the widest possible circles, the production, if the conditions are right, of a rich harvest. The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction. The question to be looked into is why a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically was organised in a way that made this agricultural metaphor seem adequate.
Since television as a technology is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies. Attempts or experiments with other forms of organisation in the long run remained just that - attempts and experiments. Two little-known, distinct alternatives deserve mentioning since they highlight what television might have been - in a different social context.
Experiments with two-way television as a possible replacement for the ordinary telephone were followed up, so to speak, by radio amateurs in Britain in the early 1930s. Various popular science journals, such as Radio News, had detailed articles about how to construct television transmitters and receivers and, throughout the 1930s, experimenting amateurs were active in many parts of the country. But Big Business, represented by the British Radio Manufacturers Association, in 1938 agreed upon standards for television equipment and channel regulations which drove the grass-roots activists out. And so there passed, at least in Britain, the historical 'moment' for a counter-cultural development of television as a widely diffused, grass-roots, egalitarian form of communication.
Broadcasting in some form was, however, tied not only to strong economic interests, but also to the deep structures of modern societies. In spite of the activities of TV amateurs, television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibition in the USA in the early 1930s, and as such often thought to be a potential competitor of the film industry. In fact, television was throughout the 19030s predominantly watched in public settings also outside of the USA. For example, in Britain, public viewing of television was the way in which most early audiences actually experienced the medium and this was even more the case in Germany. While the vision of grass-roots or amateur, two-way television was quite obviously doomed to a very marginal position at the very best, television systems largely based on collective public reception were in fact operating in several countries in the 1930s and may, with the benefit of hindsight, be seen as having presented more of a threat to the domestication of the medium. But it was a threat that was not to materialise.
Manufacturers saw the possibilities for mass sales of domestic sets as soon as the price could be reduced, and given the division and relation between the public and private domains fundamental to modernity, centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience was clearly the most adequate organisation of the medium. As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society from about the 1920s onwards, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states. And all of this is now also happening on a global scale.
There is a clear relationship between the basic processes of social modernisation and the dominant structures of broadcasting. While social and economic modernisation meant increasing centralisation and concentration of capital and political power, the break-up of traditional communities produced new ways of life. Mobility was both social and geographical, and both forms implied that individuals and households were, both literally and metaphorically, 'on the move' in ways that left them relatively isolated compared to people in much more stable early communities. Centralised broadcasting was both an answer to the need felt by central government to reach all citizens with important information efficiently, and a highly useful instrument in the production of the harmonising, stabilising 'imagined community' of the nation-state.
The pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television. What is left out here is the more positive view of broadcasting as a social form suitable also for democracy. In the formation of broadcasting policies between the World Wars, the interest in broadcasting as a means of securing equal access to resources necessary for conscious, informed and autonomous participation in political, social and cultural life played a very important role in many countries. Of course television is changing, and there is the risk that the very term broadcasting becomes outmoded or at least inadequate. In which case, this metaphor will be seen only as referring to a particular organisation of audio-visual technology during a certain centralised phase of social modernisation.",C2,"{'title': '24.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology\n\n'Broadcasting' originally meant sowing seeds broadly, by hand.

The metaphor presupposes a bucket of seeds at the centre of the activity, i.e. the existence of centralised resources intended and suited for spreading - and reproduction. The question to be looked into is why a new technology that transmitted words and pictures electronically was organised in a way that made this agricultural metaphor seem adequate.\nSince television as a technology is related to various two-way forms of communication, such as the telegraph and the telephone, it is all the more striking that, from its very early days, it was envisaged as a centralised 'mass' medium. However, transmission to private homes from some centralised unit was simply in keeping with both socio-economic structures and the dominant ways of life in modern and modernising societies. Attempts or experiments with other forms of organisation in the long run remained just that - attempts and experiments. Two little-known, distinct alternatives deserve mentioning since they highlight what television might have been - in a different social context.\nExperiments with two-way television as a possible replacement for the ordinary telephone were followed up, so to speak, by radio amateurs in Britain in the early 1930s. Various popular science journals, such as Radio News, had detailed articles about how to construct television transmitters and receivers and, throughout the 1930s, experimenting amateurs were active in many parts of the country. But Big Business, represented by the British Radio Manufacturers Association, in 1938 agreed upon standards for television equipment and channel regulations which drove the grass-roots activists out. And so there passed, at least in Britain, the historical 'moment' for a counter-cultural development of television as a widely diffused, grass-roots, egalitarian form of communication.\nBroadcasting in some form was, however, tied not only to strong economic interests, but also to the deep structures of modern societies. In spite of the activities of TV amateurs, television was also primarily a medium for theatrical exhibition in the USA in the early 1930s, and as such often thought to be a potential competitor of the film industry. In fact, television was throughout the 19030s predominantly watched in public settings also outside of the USA. For example, in Britain, public viewing of television was the way in which most early audiences actually experienced the medium and this was even more the case in Germany. While the vision of grass-roots or amateur, two-way television was quite obviously doomed to a very marginal position at the very best, television systems largely based on collective public reception were in fact operating in several countries in the 1930s and may, with the benefit of hindsight, be seen as having presented more of a threat to the domestication of the medium. But it was a threat that was not to materialise.\nManufacturers saw the possibilities for mass sales of domestic sets as soon as the price could be reduced, and given the division and relation between the public and private domains fundamental to modernity, centralised broadcasting to a dispersed domestic audience was clearly the most adequate organisation of the medium. As working-class people achieved improved standards of living and entered 'consumer' society from about the 1920s onwards, the dreams of the home as a fully equipped centre for entertainment and diverse cultural experiences became realisable for the majority of inhabitants of Western nation-states. And all of this is now also happening on a global scale.\nThere is a clear relationship between the basic processes of social modernisation and the dominant structures of broadcasting. While social and economic modernisation meant increasing centralisation and concentration of capital and political power, the break-up of traditional communities produced new ways of life. Mobility was both social and geographical, and both forms implied that individuals and households were, both literally and metaphorically, 'on the move' in ways that left them relatively isolated compared to people in much more stable early communities. Centralised broadcasting was both an answer to the need felt by central government to reach all citizens with important information efficiently, and a highly useful instrument in the production of the harmonising, stabilising 'imagined community' of the nation-state.\nThe pervasiveness of these structured processes and interests rendered broadcasting the 'naturally' victorious organisation of both radio and television. What is left out here is the more positive view of broadcasting as a social form suitable also for democracy. In the formation of broadcasting policies between the World Wars, the interest in broadcasting as a means of securing equal access to resources necessary for conscious, informed and autonomous participation in political, social and cultural life played a very important role in many countries. Of course television is changing, and there is the risk that the very term broadcasting becomes outmoded or at least inadequate. In which case, this metaphor will be seen only as referring to a particular organisation of audio-visual technology during a certain centralised phase of social modernisation. ""}"

"Drop me a line! 

In our fast world of phones, fax machines and computers, the old-fashioned art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing altogether. Yet, to me, there is something about receiving a letter that cannot be matched by any other form of communication. There is the excitement of its arrival, the pleasure of seeing who it is from and, finally, the enjoyment of the contents. 
Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably began with the little notes I would write to my mother. My mother, also, always insisted I write my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday presents. It didn't matter how short or untidy they were as long as they were letters. 
When I left home at 18 to train as a doctor in London, I would write once a 
week, and so would my mother. Occasionally my father would write and it was always a joy to receive his long, amusing letters. Most of the letters from home contained just everyday events concerning my parents and their friends. Of course, we also made phone calls but it is the letters I remember most. 
There were also letters from my boyfriends. In my youth I seemed to attract people who had to work or study away at some time and I was only able to stay in touch by correspondence. But instead of harming the relationships, letter writing seemed to improve them. I found that I could often express myself more easily in writing than by talking.
I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are appreciated, but how much better to have a year's supply of news! And it's better still when it's an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. My overseas letters arrive from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have a penfriend in Australia and another in Vancouver. 
Then there's the lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn't started talking in a restaurant on the way home from holiday, if my husband hadn't taken her photo and if I hadn't asked her for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More important, if she hadn't replied, we would be the poorer for it. As it is, we now have a regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice and she has stayed with us. 
My biggest letter-writing success, however, came this summer, when my family and I stayed with my American penfriend in Texas. We had been corresponding for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was amazed that a correspondence could last so long. The local press even considered the correspondence worth reporting on the front page. 
I am pleased that my children are carrying on the tradition. Like my mother before me, I insist they write their own thank-you letters.

Caves

Research establishments and university departments around the world have invested years of research time in all aspects of caves, mainly their origins, their hydrology and their biology. Caves constitute a small but rather mysterious component of the natural environment - as such they arouse our curiosity and challenge our desire for knowledge, and consequently have had a considerable amount of research effort devoted to them. Furthermore, because of their presence as natural phenomena, they have had a long history of study, which has been intensified in those parts of the world where caves have had a direct effect on our way of life. However, the physical agility required to visit many caves means that cave research has been less in the hands of the learned professors than in most other scientific fields. Indeed there is a considerable, perhaps unique, overlap between the professional, scientific study of caves and the amateur studies carried out by those who mainly visit caves for sport.

"A history of the apple

Apples have been with us since the dawn of recorded time, in countless varieties of colour, shape and size. But the late twentieth century is in danger of squandering its heritage.

Prehistoric wilding 8,000 BC

Human beings have been munching apples since prehistoric times. They spat out apple-pips in neolithic Britain. And 10,000 years ago they left apple remains to carbonise around their Swiss and Italian lakeside homes. In Switzerland and in the regions adjoining the Caucasus mountains, ancient humans even appear to have dry-stored apple-halves for winter. But these were wild crab apples, tiny wizened fruit which, in Ancient Britain came to be known as ‘windings’. They had little in common with the apples we know today.

Norman knowledge 1000 AD

From the Romans the French learned great fruit-growing skills which were developed in the monasteries. This knowledge, which included expel cider-making, was taken to Britain from Roman times, like the dessert apple, Decio - drought to have been introduced by the Roman general, Etio. But most Roman varieties were unsuitable for the British climate and the Norman varieties rapidly took precedence. British monks continued experimenting and developing new apples, and it is from these varieties that Western apples are largely descended.

Mediaeval favourites 1200

Several kinds of apples became established in Britain during the thirteenth century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and so named because of its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until well into the eighteenth century. Its cooking panner was the Costard, which was sold in the markets of Oxford from 1296 until the end of the seventeenth century and gave us the word ‘costermonger’ - meaning someone who sells fruit and vegetables in the street. But prosperity declined as the country was hit by successive droughts, the Black Death and the Wars of the Roses. Fewer apples were produced and more were imported. This went on until the sixteenth century when Henry VIII ordered his chief fruiterer, Richard Harris, to visit France and learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with a ‘great store of grafts’ including the famous Pippins, from which he grew the first ever modern-style orchard at Teynham in Kent.

Settler treasure 1750

By the seventeenth century apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers who sailed to Canada, Australia, die US, South Africa and New Zealand took apples and apple-pips with them, counting these among their most treasured possessions. Captain Bligh of the Bounty took the first apples to Australia; Jan van Riebeeck, the founder of Cape Settlement, took them to South Africa and the Pilgrim Fathers who boarded the Mayflower carried them to America. In North America the most famous apple-planter was john Chapman, or ‘Johnny Appleseed’. Born in 1774, he planted seedling nurseries from Pennsylvania in the east through Ohio into Indiana in the west. The Indians regarded him as a medicine man and his apple-tree enthusiasm, odd clothing and religious devotion - he distributed religious tracts tom in pans for widespread circulation - stayed many folktales. He was said, for example, to be so kind to Gods creatures that he even slept with bears.

Modem Delicious 1850 

About this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer called Jesse Hiatt discovered something sprouting from the roots of a dead tree. The shoot grew into an apple tree bearing a totally new apple which Hiatt named ‘Hawkey’. He sent it to a fruit show and on biting into one the judge exclaimed ‘Delicious, delicious!’. In 1895 the apple was introduced to the trade as a ‘Delicious’ and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

Granny Smith 1850

Another of the most famous modern apples was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of transported convicts, Maria was fiercely independent, rejecting both the criminal life of her parents and the bureaucratic hypocrisy of the colonial administration. She worked as a midwife in the small township of Eastwood in New South Wales, where she was known as ‘Granny-Smith’ because she took on responsibility for maintaining the farm and orchard, which was the family’s main source of income. One day in 1868 she found a small tree pushing its way through a pile of discarded fruit. She transplanted it and before long was harvesting the world’s first major crop of green apples, soon to be famous all over the world. When asked how the tree came about she said, ‘Well, it’s just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish’ - a comment which referred not only to the fruit but also her own convict origins.

Uniformity ales 1950

Apples are now grown all over the world from Himachal Pradesh in northern India to small luxury orchards throughout Africa. Most, though, are grown commercially and come from just half a dozen varieties - usually chosen for their red skin or because they travel well rather than because they taste good. A plague of uniformity is sweeping the world, numbing the tastebuds and reducing the gene pool. While amateur gardeners in the UK have kept many old apple varieties alive, the US has lost forever most of the apples it had 100 years ago.
But consumers are starting to demand more variety. We can’t leave the responsibility of saving diversity in our apples - or any other food - up to the random selections of amateur gardeners. We must insist on a world where natural diversity is valued and protected for the benefit of all.",C1,"{'title': 'd45e1e9a-808b-4179-b7c0-df4630286158.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'A history of the apple\n\nApples have been with us since the dawn of recorded time, in countless varieties of colour, shape and size.

They had little in common with the apples we know today.\n\nNorman knowledge 1000 AD\n\nFrom the Romans the French learned great fruit-growing skills which were developed in the monasteries. This knowledge, which included expel cider-making, was taken to Britain from Roman times, like the dessert apple, Decio - drought to have been introduced by the Roman general, Etio. But most Roman varieties were unsuitable for the British climate and the Norman varieties rapidly took precedence. British monks continued experimenting and developing new apples, and it is from these varieties that Western apples are largely descended.\n\nMediaeval favourites 1200\n\nSeveral kinds of apples became established in Britain during the thirteenth century. The Old English Pearmain, recorded in 1204 and so named because of its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until well into the eighteenth century. Its cooking panner was the Costard, which was sold in the markets of Oxford from 1296 until the end of the seventeenth century and gave us the word ‘costermonger’ - meaning someone who sells fruit and vegetables in the street. But prosperity declined as the country was hit by successive droughts, the Black Death and the Wars of the Roses. Fewer apples were produced and more were imported. This went on until the sixteenth century when Henry VIII ordered his chief fruiterer, Richard Harris, to visit France and learn about apple cultivation. Harris returned with a ‘great store of grafts’ including the famous Pippins, from which he grew the first ever modern-style orchard at Teynham in Kent.\n\nSettler treasure 1750\n\nBy the seventeenth century apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers who sailed to Canada, Australia, die US, South Africa and New Zealand took apples and apple-pips with them, counting these among their most treasured possessions. Captain Bligh of the Bounty took the first apples to Australia; Jan van Riebeeck, the founder of Cape Settlement, took them to South Africa and the Pilgrim Fathers who boarded the Mayflower carried them to America. In North America the most famous apple-planter was john Chapman, or ‘Johnny Appleseed’. Born in 1774, he planted seedling nurseries from Pennsylvania in the east through Ohio into Indiana in the west. The Indians regarded him as a medicine man and his apple-tree enthusiasm, odd clothing and religious devotion - he distributed religious tracts tom in pans for widespread circulation - stayed many folktales. He was said, for example, to be so kind to Gods creatures that he even slept with bears.\n\nModem Delicious 1850 \n\nAbout this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer called Jesse Hiatt discovered something sprouting from the roots of a dead tree. The shoot grew into an apple tree bearing a totally new apple which Hiatt named ‘Hawkey’. He sent it to a fruit show and on biting into one the judge exclaimed ‘Delicious, delicious!’. In 1895 the apple was introduced to the trade as a ‘Delicious’ and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.\n\nGranny Smith 1850\n\nAnother of the most famous modern apples was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of transported convicts, Maria was fiercely independent, rejecting both the criminal life of her parents and the bureaucratic hypocrisy of the colonial administration. She worked as a midwife in the small township of Eastwood in New South Wales, where she was known as ‘Granny-Smith’ because she took on responsibility for maintaining the farm and orchard, which was the family’s main source of income. One day in 1868 she found a small tree pushing its way through a pile of discarded fruit. She transplanted it and before long was harvesting the world’s first major crop of green apples, soon to be famous all over the world. When asked how the tree came about she said, ‘Well, it’s just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish’ - a comment which referred not only to the fruit but also her own convict origins.\n\nUniformity ales 1950\n\nApples are now grown all over the world from Himachal Pradesh in northern India to small luxury orchards throughout Africa. Most, though, are grown commercially and come from just half a dozen varieties - usually chosen for their red skin or because they travel well rather than because they taste good. A plague of uniformity is sweeping the world, numbing the tastebuds and reducing the gene pool. While amateur gardeners in the UK have kept many old apple varieties alive, the US has lost forever most of the apples it had 100 years ago.\nBut consumers are starting to demand more variety. We can’t leave the responsibility of saving diversity in our apples - or any other food - up to the random selections of amateur gardeners. We must insist on a world where natural diversity is valued and protected for the benefit of all.'}"

"The tilt of the Earth has two major effects: the angle of the Sun to the earth and length of the days. 

For half of the year the Earth is tilted such that the North Pole is more pointed towards the Sun. For the other half the South Pole is pointed at the Sun. 

When the North Pole is angled toward the Sun, the days on the northern part of the planet (north of the equator) get more sunlight or longer days and shorter nights. With longer days the northern hemisphere heats up and gets summer. 

As the year progresses, the Earth's tilt changes to where the North Pole is pointing away from the Sun, producing winter. For this reason, seasons north of the Equator are the opposite of seasons south of the Equator. When it's winter in Europe and the United States, it will be summer in Brazil and Australia.

We talked about the length of the day changing, but the angle of the Sun changes as well. In summer the sunlight shines more directly on the earth giving more energy to the Earth's surface and heating it up. During the winter the sunlight hits the Earth at an angle. This gives less energy and doesn't heat the Earth as much. 

In the Northern Hemisphere the longest day is on June 21st while the longest night is on December 21st. It's just the opposite in the Southern Hemisphere where the longest day is December 21st and the longest night is June 21st. There are two days a year where the day and night is exactly the same.

"Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Marx claimed that religion was ""the opium of the masses"". Did he mean by this that the church provided people with some drugs? Not exactly, what he did mean is that religion has always been a good way of keeping people under some control. Until the Modern Ages most of the people were illiterate, and they didn't have the opportunity to study, so that only the clergy had some knowledge which made it possible for them to spread the Truth among the masses. So people never developed any critical mind which would have enabled them to question the authority. It was all the easier for the Church to manipulate those people who were so accustomed to following the rules that they wouldn't have even thought of debating them .
They were under the influence of a drug which annihilated the functions of the human brain .
In our society religion doesn't play such a role any more, but we may wonder to what extent television does play a similar function today...
To begin with, it seems clear to me that from time immemorial people have needed some diversions. The legal authorities of a country have always seen in those distractions a good way of keeping the masses away from interfering too much in state matters. So did the Romans emperors for instance provide people with all that they most wanted -""panem et cicenses"", bread and circus games - in order to keep them away from questioning policy .
Nowadays television turns out to play the same role as those ancient games: this is why we may now speak of the stupefying effect of television on the masses. In other words, television is a kind of drug which keeps peole in lethargy, and it prevents them from developing a sharp critical taste .
This is mainly due to the bad quality of the programmes that are broadcast by the different TV-channels, which don't aim at enhancing the intellectual level of the audience, but rather at attracting the largest possible audience. Therefore, most TV programmes at peak hours will consist of game shows, soap operas, American series, or other sensational ""reality shows""...
In this respect, it is obvious that governments have some control over the making of those programmes. Governments grant money to the national TV channels and they exert censorship. They see to it that television is used as a sleeping drug or as a means of influencing the TV-watcher .
Recent historical events such as the Gulf-war or the Rumanian ""revolution"" have clearly illustrated the importance of television as a means of propaganda .
At the beginning of the ""Gulf-crisis"" most Americans were unlike their government against any armed intervention of their country in Kuwait. The Bush Administration, in order to have those recalcitrants on its side, didn't hesitate to make up terrifying stories about what was supposed to have taken place in Iraq. American TV-channels also broadcast a series of programmes about the way Iraqi soldiers took newborn children off the hands of their mothers in order to build up their army .
All this information, which soon turned out to have been invented, had such an horrifying effect on the American audience that nothing could prevent the USA from sending troops to the Gulf...
A few months before, the Rumanian dissenters had roused the indignation of Western countries by broadcasting very moving programmes about the atrocities which were supposed to have taken place in Timisoara, these later proved to be false .
Another negative aspect of television is the effect it can have on people, especially on children .
Indeed, television creates an illusionary world in which children believe because it is all the more difficult for them to make a clear distinction between fiction and reality .
The recent tragedy in Liverpool has once more drawn our attention to the delicate issue of the influence of television on a child's behaviour. Is television responsible for the rising violence among children?
There is no absolute certainty about this. Some sociologists argue that television has a cathartic effect on people. In that case, it would be an outlet for some emotions rather than the cause of a rising violence .
I don't agree with those sociologists, because I keep thinking that television causes violence rather than discouraging it. Furthermore, I am deeply convinced that parents should be more careful as regards the education of their children. They should try to put an end to the hegemony of television, by finding a substitute for it .",C1,"{'title': '153_FRUL2017.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses.

"WEATHERVANE MAKER

THE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill, going back to early Egyptian times. Today the craft is still very much alive in the workshop that Graham Smith has set up. He is one of the few people in the country who make hand-cut weathervanes. Graham’s designs are individually created and tailored to the specific requirements of his customers. ‘That way I can produce a unique personalised item,’ he explains. ‘A lot of my customers are women buying presents for their husbands. They want a distinctive gift that represents the man’s business or leisure interests.’
It’s all a far cry from the traditional cockerel, the most common design for weathervanes.
It was not a cockerel but a witch on a broomstick that featured on the first weathervane Graham ever made. Friends admired his surprise present for his wife and began asking him to make vanes for them. ‘I realised that when it came to subjects that could be made into them, the possibilities were limitless,’ he says.
Graham decided to concentrate his efforts on a weathervane business. He had sewed an apprenticeship as a precision engineer and had worked in that trade for 15 years when he and his wife, Liz, agreed to swap roles - she went out to work as an architectural assistant and he stayed at home to look after the children and build up the business.
That was five years ago and he has no regrets about his new direction. ‘My previous work didn’t have an artistic element to it, whereas this is exciting and creative,’ he says. ‘I really enjoy the design side.’
Graham has now perfected over 100 original designs. He works to very fine detail, always seeking approval for the design of the silhouette from the customer before proceeding with the hand-cutting.
Graham also keeps plenty of traditional designs in stock, since they prove as popular as the one-offs. ‘It seems that people are attracted to hand-crafting,’ Graham says. ‘They welcome the opportunity to acquire something a little bit different.’
Graham has no plans for expansion, as he wants to keep the business as a rural craft.
‘I have found my place in the market. People love the individuality and I get a lot of satisfaction from seeing a nondescript shape turn into something almost lifelike,’ he says.
‘For centuries, weathervanes have kept communities in touch with the elements signalling those shifts in wind direction that bring about changes in the weather,’ he explains.
‘And nowadays, with more and more people moving to the country, individuals want to put an exclusive finishing touch to their properties. It has been a boost to crafts like mine.’
Graham has become increasingly busy, supplying flat-packed weathervanes to clients worldwide.
American and Danish buyers in particular are showing interest. ‘Pricing,’ he explains, ‘depends on the intricacy of the design.’ His most recent request was for a curly-coated dog. Whatever the occasion, Graham can create a gift with a difference.",C1,"{'title': '38f8f862-0e1b-480f-acaa-ff2cf3e909d9.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'WEATHERVANE MAKER\n\nTHE MAKING of weathervanes is an ancient skill, going back to early Egyptian times.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

	Since the advent of neural synapse in human brain people were concerned how to turn ideas into action. You should keep in mind that the question provided can be subjectively addressed by anyone who comes across with it. Here I'll briefly mention two thick walls that separate us from the spectrum of knowledge and practice. To begin with, the lack of the right method of learning within universities. Secondly, the absence of sheer will force in each and every individual within the period of education. With these contextual and intrapersonal factors, the graduates can rarely relate university learning to real life problems therefore I think the university degrees are becoming more theoretical nationally . 

	Throughout the world or at least in the developed countries the current established method of learning is PBL(Problem Based Learning), unfortunately we are still living in the stone era of implementing the modern approaches and methods of education in the curriculum design. The method Problem-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject just like real life through the experience of problem solving. Students learn both thinking strategies and domain knowledge. The goals of PBL are to help the students develop flexible knowledge, effective problem solving skills, self-directed learning, effective collaboration skills and intrinsic motivation that are critically important in encountering real life situations. The tutor builds students' confidence to take on the problem, and encourages the students, while also stretching their understanding. PBL represents a paradigm shift from traditional teaching and learning philosophy, which is more often lecture-based, theoretically passed, contains way more theoretical units than practical ones and it is used in the whole nation as the primary method of teaching. PBL educates students in a way that they would behave efficiently not only in a domain specific task but also in real life problem solving ones. Our system of education lacks such a perfectly designed method of teaching and learning. So the students cannot benefit from real life stimulations and as a result the problem of relating university learning to real life situations arises.


	Preparation for real life starts since birth. From childhood the humans interacts with the real world through trial and error, reasoning and prior experience of others. Consequently each human being perceives the surrounding world differently from one another; some choose to gain experience from a mistake and look at it positively, meanwhile others try to ignore the whole happening and bury it deep down among other unpleasant errors of human kind. Like all the changes in human condition success comes from will; with the brute force of perseverance the individual can outwit the real life challenge eventually. Since this four legged creature is capable of thinking and making decisions from childhood, in the end the choice is up to the person whether to develop a will toward succession or to be doomed to failure. Observational studies have shown that people think life is becoming harder to get by each year. The reasons and motives for such negative attitude could be economical, regional, psychological, physiological, political, cultural and personal. Thus not having the required volition causes increased rates of difficulty in encountering real life situations . 


The failure in preparation of students for real life can be caused by two reasons. First, problem of do not having the right implemented approach to learning, teaching and assessment that could best serve the growing number of applicants in different fields of study in order to relate theory to practice in real life. Second, we have the power of will; you and I know that it would have the strength to melt mountains to the surface if it is used in a way to see problems solvable and goals reachable.

"Observing Lions

In the popular imagination, lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset, a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals, rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case, their next meal. But after spending many years observing these creatures in the wild, we have acquired a less exalted view. 
When we started our research in 1978, we hoped to discover why lions teamed up to hunt, rear cubs and among other things, scare off rivals with chorused roars. If the ultimate success of an animals behaviour is measured by its lifetime production of surviving offspring, then cooperation does not necessarily pay: if an animal is too generous, its companions benefit at its expense. Why, then, did not the evolutionary rules of genetic self-interest seem to apply to lions?
We confidently assumed that we would be able to resolve that issue in two to three years. But lions are supremely adept at doing nothing. To the list of inert noble gases, including krypton, argon and neon, we would add lion. Thus it has taken a variety of research measures to uncover clues about the cats behaviour. Because wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear. 

Pop Music Review

The release of Bedrock's third album was more than just a landmark in the career of a talented but hitherto precarious band. New Life launched a movement that effectively redesigned the specification of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Out went the earnest angst, plain-shirted drabness and overdriven guitars of a previous era; in came a lighter blend of melodious homegrown styles. A mix of social observation and strident anger mingled easily here with the sound of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humour and irony were well to the fore, as were the voices that felt no need to disguise their origins.
The album showed Bedrock to be skilful magpie collectors and observers, and a cunningly versatile team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they went larkily after traditional English preoccupations such as sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album's real strength lay in the gentle melancholy depths it plumbed on tracks such as 'So Low', a gorgeous unfurling tune loosely hung around the theme of meteorology, and 'To the Brink', a ballad that allowed no smirking at the back. The beauty of New Life is its consistently sky-high quality - 16 tracks with absolutely no filler remains an unsurpassed record in the era of loiteringly long CDs.

Extract from an autobiography

As a child I was always fascinated by stories of 'The Sibyl', those mysteriously wise women who wielded such influence in the ancient world. To begin with, I only knew of the existence of one who appeared in a tale my mother had told me. An old woman of Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused and she burnt three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused, she again burnt three books. He bought the remaining three for the full 300 gold pieces. 
I realised even then that there was a profound truth hidden in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and in life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I used to ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would beg to join me. It worked. It was another lesson that I've never forgotten.
When I was given the chance to write a travel book, I had to look for something that I could bear to find out about, something that was relevant to my life. I'm a reluctant traveller - at the first opportunity I sent my editor a very long list of places I wasn't prepared to go to. When it comes down to it, I'm only interested in ruins, because the travel I like is the travel of the mind through time.

What becomes of your manuscript?

When you submit your manuscript it will most likely join a heap waiting for someone to sort and sift before it topples over - the so-called slush pile. The someone is usually either the editorial department junior (i.e. under 18) or an old hand who comes in a couple of mornings a week and is paid by the hour. Neither of these has much influence, but they are basically on your side and out to discover something original - the junior to make his or her name and acquire an author of their own if they are lucky, the old hand to justify continuing freelance employment.
If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it on to a more senior editor and eventually it will surface at an acquisition meeting. The championing editor will not only have to justify accepting your novel on the grounds of intrinsic merit and potential sales, but also say whether you as an author seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). Also the question is raised of how promotable you are likely to be - an important factor - when a new novel needs all the help it can get.

"Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
In our society , religion used to be very important for the people. In the older days, almost everyone believed in God. God used to be their source of inspiration, their support. In those days, people were religious, not only because they really believe, but also because it was a moral tradition and obligation for them to believe in God. Otherwise they feared to be pointed at by their neighbours and friends .
Peole went to church every Sunday. They used to pray a lot. For instance, when there was a thunderstorm, people prayed for the thunderstorm to go away. They also prayed before dinner to thank God for their meal .
Nowadays, those aspects are more or less gone. People do not go to church that often anymore. A lot of people want to believe that they are good christians. They baptize their children when born; they do their first and solemn communion; they marry in church; but actually you only see them twice a year in church: at Easter and with Christmas .
To come back to the aspect of marriage: when people got married in the older days, it was [Quotation] . So it was an important step in life. Nowadays, marriage is still important, but if it does not work out, people do not hesitate to get a divorce. Divorce is not such a taboo anymore. It seems as if you can get a divorce every day .
Of course, in this essay, I deal with some aspects of christianity. I do not say that this phenomenon occurs in every religion. These days, you still have a few strong religions e.g. the Islam and Buddhism .

If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television \n \nIn our society , religion used to be very important for the people. In the older days, almost everyone believed in God. God used to be their source of inspiration, their support. In those days, people were religious, not only because they really believe, but also because it was a moral tradition and obligation for them to believe in God. Otherwise they feared to be pointed at by their neighbours and friends .\nPeole went to church every Sunday. They used to pray a lot. For instance, when there was a thunderstorm, people prayed for the thunderstorm to go away. They also prayed before dinner to thank God for their meal .\nNowadays, those aspects are more or less gone. People do not go to church that often anymore. A lot of people want to believe that they are good christians. They baptize their children when born; they do their first and solemn communion; they marry in church; but actually you only see them twice a year in church: at Easter and with Christmas .\nTo come back to the aspect of marriage: when people got married in the older days, it was [Quotation] . So it was an important step in life. Nowadays, marriage is still important, but if it does not work out, people do not hesitate to get a divorce. Divorce is not such a taboo anymore. It seems as if you can get a divorce every day .\nOf course, in this essay, I deal with some aspects of christianity. I do not say that this phenomenon occurs in every religion.

"Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Is there a place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world, dominated by science, technology, and industrialisation?
In the dictionary it says that the word ""dream"" means ""an ambition or an ideal""
If we were to use this as a definition of what dreaming is, my immediate answer would be ""yeas!""
This because, I think, in most of the western societies people feel as they don't have much more left to fight for. We get the feeling that technology and science will take care of all ""visible"" problems, such as health problems, environmental problems, etc. Industrialism has developed a strong economy in most of these countries, and the young people growing up today, were born into a wealthy family. Most of what is to fight for, are issues that has already been taken care of by previous generations .
If you ask some of the teenagers who are taking drugs today, why they do it, their answer is often ""I'm board"". There exist, I think a feeling of emptiness among many people. Almost every thing is for free, so to speak. This emptiness can lead to destructive drug use, but also for some people a search for something more spiritual, and new ideas of what things in life that is most valuable. This is what makes us continue to dream, and there for my answer to the question is also ""no"". We are travelling more now than ever before, we are interested in unknown cultures, in new ways of looking at life. Being a Buddhist is hip. People also mix different ideas from several religions. Some call it ""Shopping religion"".
What about using imagination? Even though our society has been dominated by industrialisation, science, and technology for quit some time now, there still exist a lot of creativity. The 20th century brought new ways of making art, music and literature .
Young people today, who grew up with computer games, and MTV, being used to entertainment almost every minute of the day, are just as much creative human beings as generations before. If not, there wouldn't have been so many new artists, writers, painters etc. A need of a room for using imagination makes people trying to find one .
My conclusion is that a society dominated by science, technology and industrialisation is not enough for most of us. In the 20th century human beings has in many ways desperately been trying to find their spirit. This shows in arts, filmmaking, literature as Modernism, and in new philosophies, such as Existentialism. The war protests, the civil writes demonstrations, and Flower Power in the 60's, was a result of people dreaming of change .
Good material conditions do not necessary mean happiness, a society that includes everyone and spiritual satisfaction, it does not makes us stop dreaming, it encourage us to dream even more. Sadly many people does not know any better than to by a dream as in a new car or replacing spiritualism with drugs. But still I believe that dreaming and using our imagination is one of the things that make us human, and the most of us will continue the never ending searching for the ""new"".",B2,"{'title': '344_NOUO2025.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination.

"Jack ran down one street and up the next. He turned left. He turned right. He ran and ran. Then he listened. He couldn't hear the sailors. He was free! But he had the chains on his hands.
He saw a store and opened the doors. Then he went in, very carefully. It was dark, but he could see some swords and knives.
""Ah, a blacksmith's store,"" he thought. ""I can use one of those knives.""
He took one and started to cut the chains. It was hard work, and it hurt his hands. But after a minute or two the chains fell to the floor.
Suddenly, Jack heard a sound behind him. It was Will Turner.
""What are you doing here?"" asked Will. He looked at Jack. ""Oh, you're the pirate. People are looking for you.""
He took a sword.
""Is that a good idea?"" asked Jack.
Will didn't speak. He put up his sword and looked at Jack.
They fought. Jack was quick, but Will was quick, too.

"Title: Mobile phones used more intelligently

Nowadays, almost everyone has a mobile phone and one is not surprised to hear a mobile ringing on a bus or tram. However, it is very disturbing if someone is phoning loudly on a means of transport. Mobiles ringing during a lecture or a seminar or in the middle of an intimate conversation can be even more annoying. Unfortunately, being late is not considered so badly nowadays because one can always postpone the appointment by sending a text message. Taking all these into consideration, a more intelligent use of mobile phones should be encouraged in our rushing hi-tech world.
Firstly, it is very disturbing if someone is communicating on his mobile very loudly on a bus or tram. Lots of people have to travel through the city every day to reach their workplace or their school. Some of them use the time of travelling for reading, studying or even trying to rest. Being forced to listen to someone's conversation because it is so loud, violates their human rights. It should be forbidden to talk on the phone loudly on the means of public transport.
Secondly, it is also very disturbing if a mobile phone rings during a lecture or a seminar at university. Although, it is common knowledge that students should switch off their mobiles when attending a lecture or a seminar, it is not important enough for them. During my university years there were several occasions when someone forgot to switch off his mobile and in the middle of the lesson it started to ring loudly. It was even worse when the person whose phone rang could not find his mobile easily and it continued to ring for several seconds. It should be taken more seriously to switch off one's mobiles before going to a lecture or a seminar.
Finally, when one is involved in an intimate conversation and his mobile rings, the other person may feel very disappointed. It can be interpreted as a lack of respect if one starts talking on the phone with someone else while the original co-converser is waiting for the continuation of the conversation.
Using a mobile can be considered a very good device if one has an appointment and wants to postpone it because of being late. However, it is much likely to be late if one knows that he can send a text message to postpone the appointment. Probably, if one did not have this possibility, one would be more punctual.
In conclusion, there are several occasions in one's life when it is indisputable that mobiles are not used properly. Talking loudly on a means of transport or mobiles ringing during a lecture or seminar can be very disturbing. Moreover, starting to talk to someone else on the phone during a one-to-one conversation or postponing more and more appointments by sending a text message can be a sign of lack of respect.

"A long time ago there lived, in Pennsylvania, a little boy whose name
was Benjamin West.

This boy loved pictures. Indeed, there were few things that he loved
more. But he had never seen any pictures except a few small ones in
a book. His father and mother were Quakers, and they did not think it
was right to spend money for such things. They thought that pictures
might take one's mind away from things that were better or more useful.

One day Benjamin's mother had to go to a neighbor's on some errand.
So she told Benjamin to stay in the house and take care of his baby
sister till she came back.

He was glad to do this; for he loved the baby.

""Yes, mother,"" he said, ""I will watch her every minute. I won't let
anything hurt her.""

The baby was asleep in her cradle, and he must not make a noise and
waken her. For some time he sat very still. He heard the clock ticking.
He heard the birds singing. He began to feel a little lonesome.

A fly lighted on the baby's cheek, and he brushed it away. Then he
thought what a pretty picture might be made of his sister's sweet face
and little hands.

He had no paper, but he knew where there was a smooth board. He had
no pencil, but there was a piece of black charcoal on the hearth. How
pretty the baby was! He began to draw. The baby smiled but did not
wake up.",B1,"{'title': 'text_133.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'A long time ago there lived, in Pennsylvania, a little boy whose name\nwas Benjamin West.\n\nThis boy loved pictures.

"Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
Capital punishment is the harshest form of punishment enforced in the world today. Whoever violates the law should be sentenced, by either serving himself in prison or being given a death penalty. Consequently, it's quite clear that criminals who had committed murder should face the executions for their evil deeds .
However, death penalty strikes some people as too cruel, and it is believed that it shouldn't always be carried out to deprive the murder of his life so easily. Therefore, capital punishment becomes a difficult issue in discussion and there are many different opinions about it, especially in America, where human rights are highly respected and capital punishment has already been abolished in some states .
Anyway, it is always true that everything in the world cannot be defined exactly as right or wrong, so we should be objective toward an issue, and look at it all-roundly. And it is the same with the view that whether capital punishment should be carried out in all cases in murder .
Generally speaking, capital punishment should be carried out in most of the cases in murder. First of all, it's obvious that punishments are made to punish those criminals and to prevent crimes, and would positively give a potential pause in the thought process of the murderer, using fear as an incentive for preventing recurrence. The harshest punishment for murder will set up an alarm for those potential criminals. If only they value their lives, they would not commit murder so carelessly .
Besides, once a person is proved guilty of murder, he should be sentenced to death, because justice must be served. Only placing murderers in prison isn't a tough enough punishment, since in jail they would have a possible chance for parole. But they actually did kill someone, and they should pay for it life for life. What's more, for the sake of the security of the whole society, we have to be some kind of inhuman or cruel to sentence those murderers to death, so that justice is served by executing them. They deserve it. They have caused much grievance to the family and friends of the victim, and execution seems like the only way that justice can be served. And only in this way, would the punishment fit the crime and would the victims' family and society get some comfort from the grievance and recover from the resentment .
However, things are not so absolute. When we return to the ""nature"" of the crime committed, there are some cases in which the murder has some reason to be excused. For example, he might be arguing with someone when he suddenly flied to rage, and beat that person to death without control. Actually, he didn't intend to do so, but in such a circumstance, he was out of ration; after the tragedy happened, he had regretted to death .
Similarly, there are many other possible cases that people killed someone by accident. They are not guilt in nature, but made some terrible mistakes - against their will. They don not seem to be that detestable to be executed just because of their offence through negligence. Some punishment in jail is enough to them, since he has already been condemned by the society, suffered great pain in his heart, and served himself in prison as punishment. He was taught to know that one should control his temper however bad the situation is. Provide the family of the victim and the society consent to forgiving the murderer, he can be given the chance of being good again .
Overall, capital punishment is an effective approach to punish murderers and prevent crimes furthermore. It should be carried out to protect the security of the society, and to hold the justice firmly, but there can be some exceptions. When the case of murder is special and when the murderer is pitied and forgiven by the society, the justice and the jury can make their decision by taking into consideration the circumstances, and try to avoid using the capital punishment .",B2,"{'title': '051_CNUK1149.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. \n \nCapital punishment is the harshest form of punishment enforced in the world today.

"Dinosaurs

No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago, a long time before there were any people on the earth. Nobody knows for sure why they all died.
The nearest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds.

"Title: Why should anyone study foreign languages?

You can hear it everywhere and from everybody that, today, studying foreign languages is almost compulsory. It can be of direct use to the learner when he or she goes abroad. And reasons for going abroad are numerous nowadays. It is not only a matter of having fun and going on holiday. If we take into account the situation of the European Community there is no denying the fact that the use of foreign languages can become important in your job situation. It might even be just the extra qualification you need to get a job at all .
Imagine yourself being sent to an international congress in the U.S. on behalf of your company. You are expected to return with detailed information on the latest development on the international market. You may still feel quite comfortable with the American congress. Usually one can gather the gist of the lectures with what you remember of your English learnt in school. Yet being sent to France could already be more of a risk, since they will most probably stick to French there, as the French are known for showing little inclination to giving up their mother tongue .
Of course, studying foreign languages is not all about jobs and career. Being on holiday travelling through a remote, sleepy village in the Tatra mountains in Slovakia or passing through an old, rustic wine-growing estate at the foot of wavy hills patched with green and ochre, sun-burnt vines in the south of France, you will feel so much closer to the natives and the country when you are able to ask your way around or even have a chat with them. Communication in a foreign country enhances the intercultural aspect of your holidays considerably .
I know what I am talking about. I had been doing English for eight years at school and for three more years at university when I decided to spend a couple of weeks travelling round Britain and Ireland, spending a sort of educational holiday there to brush up my geographic and cultural knowledge of it. I started the tour in a small, yet picturesque and lively little seaside resort right at the coast of Northern Ireland. It was the first evening of my holidays and I was keen on getting to know people, talking to native speakers. I was out for the authentic kind of information these people were supposed to be able to deliver as recommended over and over again by teachers and lecturers at home .
In eager anticipation I went to the local pub. As I had hoped I met people very quickly. They were very friendly. At least I could tell that from their behaviour. I could not tell it from what they were saying though, because I did not understand a word. The first man I talked to was the pub owner behind the bar. He was an old man lacking some teeth and mumbling terribly. I thought, ""well, too bad, but I would probably have difficulties understanding him in my own language..."". Yet I had but little less problems understanding ""average"" speakers .
This only started to improve after three or four weeks when I had got used to the peculiarities of different accents and dialects. Only then could I start to talk to people without asking them three times to repeat what they had just said, which really makes natural and relaxed conversation impossible. So I would still recommend that studying foreign languages is a nice and noble thing to do; but do not expect it to be of too much direct use when you go abroad!",C2,"{'title': '159_GEAU4011.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Why should anyone study foreign languages?\n\nYou can hear it everywhere and from everybody that, today, studying foreign languages is almost compulsory.

"Conduct becoming 

Giving directions to an orchestra is never easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work. 

A. ANNE MANSON 

When Anne Manson, 30, asked if she could attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna, she found herself standing in for an absent assistant. She was then asked to help on another opera the next season. 'I had to take the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I always had a good attitude to standing up in front of an orchestra.' American-born Manson works with a well established London-based opera company which concentrates on modern works. She is also building a reputation in other European countries, which she has visited with financial aid from the British Arts Council, and, since that first occasion, she has assisted Abbado on several more projects. 

B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE 

The most difficult part of being a conductor is deciding how to convince people to present you with the right opportunities; saysAndrew Constantine, 31, who won a major competition in 1991, after failed attempts in two other contests. Looking back, he is grateful for the timing: 'If it had happened any earlier, I am sure I would have disappeared without trace: The competition provided many performance opportunities and a period as assistant to a well-known conductor, but Constantine is finding it difficult to lose the 'competition' label: 'If in three years' time my name is still associated with the competition then I will be worried,' he says.'But orchestras such as the English Chamber Orchestra who took me on after the competition are now inviting me back. If this doesn't happen,your career will gradually fall to pieces.' 

C. WASFI KANI 

Wasfi Kani, who set up Pimlico Opera, loves the long practice period which is part of any opera production. 'The music is worth four weeks' attention; says Kani, who started conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she supported herself by working in London's commercial centre until Pimlico Opera turned fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons 
with Sian Edwards was the key moment for her. 'I saw her conduct and realised she was the same size as me - I had always been taught by much bigger people which makes a huge difference.' She likes the complicated nature of opera: 'There are lots of arguments, and you've got singers' personalities to consider ... ' 

D. ROGER VIGNOLES 

'Conducting has come upon me as something of a surprise, but it holds great fascination for me,' says Roger Vignoles, 48. In fact, it's not such a strange career move. He started out as a resident musician with an opera house, and worked with good conductors. Last year he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. 'It was much less difficult than I thought. I found I knew the music well, I knew what I wanted it to sound like, and I tried my best to get the performance I wanted. Fortunately, people have respected my ability as a musician generally. I am benefiting from every piece of experience I've ever had, both in musical style and in the actual business of performing. Now I will do whatever people ask me to do so I can find out what I like doing.' 

E. WAYNE MARSHALL 

It was back in 1986 that the conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor on one of his productions and told his agent about Wayne Marshall. Marshall, now 32, soon found himself conducting a musical in London at short notice, a difficult beginning. He even had to deal with some over-relaxed professional musicians reading newspapers during the show: 'I was just tough with them. I always gave a clear beat and got the best result I could. A lot of orchestral musicians I've seen don't seem to need advice and instruction from a conductor. But I'm never afraid to say what I want. If people see you're worried, it gets worse. I've never studied conducting formally and no book tells you how to conduct but people have been kind to me. I am determined and I know what I like.'",B2,"{'title': 'b64d0077-f0f5-4829-badb-ccd70c19ba4a.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Conduct becoming \n\nGiving directions to an orchestra is never easy.

"A few days after this, Virginia and her young admirer went out riding in the fields. But a tree tore her riding skirt very badly, and when they got home she went up the back stairs to mend it. She was running past the half-open door of one of the rooms when she saw someone inside. It was, she  thought, her mother's servant, who sometimes took her needlework there.

The ghost looked round in surprise at the pretty little girl who was daring to speak to him. ' It's silly to ask me to behave myself,' he answered. 'Very silly.'

"HOW DO THE IRISH POP-GROUP 'BOYZONE' LIVE A HEALTHY LIFE?

Sleeping well is very important. When I can get home to my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. But I find it very difficult to sleep at night after a concert because my head is full of music.
Sport is important. Before I had a car accident I was at the sports centre two and a half hours a day, five days a week. I can't do that now so I do about 150 sit-ups a day.
I don't drink alcohol or smoke. I try to eat well. Also I drink a lot of water because it's good for your health. I should have about eight glasses a day but I don't always drink so much.
People shouldn't work all the time. I love my job but there are other things I like doing too. In my free time I just listen to music or watch TV. It's good for you to do nothing sometimes.

"Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money is the root of all evil This assertion may be false on the one hand because human beings need money to live on for some of us at least to survive .
Let us think to all the poor people in the world who desperately seek money to live at subsistence level, let us think to the third-world who asks the so-called industrialized and rich countries to help them in keeping alive their people. We must remember all the concerts organized to raise money and this to save people or countries from starvation .
There had been ""USA for Africa"", ""Band Aid"". So they stood up for starvation but also for many illness, notably AIDS or leukaemia or simply to save the world, let us remeber the concert to save the Amazonian forest .
On the other hand money perverts those who exaggerate, it is a kind of escalation iin the scale of possession, because for this kind of people possession rhymes with power and domination .
Let us give good and convincing examples of people perverted by money. Two or three days ago, a bank director robbed his own bank, he then left the country with his private secretary. why some famous ministers falsify their accounts, if not for money. Why do they risk to loose their job, their notoriety, their self respect? The only possible reason is money attraction .
There are only two subjects on earth that have the power to pervert people and to make them do anything crazy, those two subjects are love and money .
Therefore we can consider that love and money are the roots of all evil .
So money really perverts people, because if we look at the politics side we will see politicians playing with their money either to buy voters or trying to raise funds. Some organizations are known to use their money to commit crimes, murders, to buy or sell drugs, in one word, actually drug traffic .
Some countries use their power to buy weapons and then to sell them to other countries in need, during wars for instance. Some countries use their power and their money to help researchers in the elaboration of nuclear weapons that are each time more sophisticated and this for the country to acquire each time more power, and may be to be the leader in one field .
But sometimes countries want and need researchers not only for bad discoveries but also for good ones .
Actually all the industrialized world pays for scientific discoveries, we must not forget all the progress made in the medical field for example. Discoveries are also made during space researches. All thisrequire money .
If we look at it, all in all, we need money to make science and to build up history, to give it to those who don't possess it, to survive and even to live comfortably .
But some of us use it in a bad way that is either they want to earn more even if they resort to illegal transactions or they spend the money they have, to acquire power .

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

	As the science gains momentum, so do the applicants for universities. Call it keeping up with the Joneses or a deep-rooted passion for learning for the sake of it, the number of graduated students at various levels of education in different fields is skyrocketing. Each semester, loads of alumni with their degrees are injected to the vessel of job seeking and working systems, but the question is: Can they get the most of their acquired knowledge or they are holding merely a certificate and they are literally some chassis stuffed with absurd theories, ineffective regarding to real world? Well, the question has its own proponents and opponents. Here come some of their claims:
	On one hand, advocates may say that university is a place that offers a spectrum of miscellaneous subjects. If you are smart enough, you will be able to make them work for you, even if they are just sheer theories and nothing more. Furthermore, they might say that science is based on theories, then the theory is a prerequisite to almost any kind of job, as a result, by knowing a set of theories regarding to a specific issue, you can check on different aspects and dimensions, subsequently you will be able to come up with better solutions and make up for the probable upcoming shortfalls and that is what segregates the grassroots from the elites . (In a sense that you consider a university - graduated person an elite!). So for them, universities are no vocational training place and if someone wants to get hold of such functional skills, s/he can register at a university which provides such abilities such as: University of Applied Science and Technology.
	Turning to the other side of the argument, the martinet opponents claim that the society is in desperate need of dexterous labor force, not heads inflated with theories. The moderate ones may say that theories are necessary but not sufficient. They go further that there should be a link between these written formats, their corresponding usage and the real, tangible issue, but unfortunately, in many cases, this ring is lost. They claim that instead of theories, the element of logic behind the theory and the problem should be taught, otherwise, getting hands on concrete, useless forms written in books, articles, journals, etc. can be achieved without the assistance of professors, i.e. it is not of complex nature and almost any normal, literate person with an average-to-above IQ can understand and grasp the material more or less. Then we can conclude that for them, mere theory holders have no place in a working society.
	I myself am likely to go for the second group, but at the same time, I cannot deny the very fact of this simple but oh-so-true sentence: Education is never worthless, even if it is too sheer a theory, it can come handy, at least it broadens and widens the peoples' attitudes, makes them look at the issue from another angle and also exercises their minds. To my way of thinking, we can have some solutions which a couple of them are listed below:
	We can say that if universities provide hands-on workshops alongside the material, this controversy can somehow be alleviated. One other probable solution is to run needs analysis for each occupation and design teaching materials in a suitable framework to establish the above-mentioned link.
	There still remains another problem, which is the supply and demand issue. The question is that do we really need as many graduated students in our working system - even if almost all of them are so assiduous a student - as currently we have? Or there should always be an unremitting competition for job vacancies?",C1,"{'title': '221_IRMA10001.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world.

"We often hear on radio and television news about the Dow Jones and NASDAQ indexes. What are these? NASDAQ is the world’s largest electronic stock market, trading shares of companies in many different industries, including technology, retail, financial services, communications and biotechnology. In 1896, Dow Jones & Company, a financial publisher, launched what is now known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It tracks the stock performance of thirty top U.S. companies, and is considered to be a barometer of the U.S. stock market. So when you hear that either the Dow or the NASDAQ is up or down, it means, in general, that a number of popular stocks are either going up or down in share price. 
If you’d like to invest in stocks, but you don’t have the time to study individual companies and their stock’s performance, there’s an alternative. It’s a mutual fund. When you buy into a mutual fund, you become an investor in many different companies. You become part of a group of people who put their money together and pay a professional investment manager to buy the stocks. As a result, you don’t have to watch the ups and downs of each stock; you just follow the overall value of the mutual fund. 
The idea behind a mutual fund is that it “spreads risk.” That means that if the fund invests in Company A, and its stock loses value, another company in the fund, Company B, may on the same day, increase in value. The gains in Company B may even cancel out the losses in Company A – so you might not lose anything. So, by spreading the risk, the mutual fund can help guard against losses.",B2,"{'title': 'text_192.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'We often hear on radio and television news about the Dow Jones and NASDAQ indexes.

NASDAQ is the world’s largest electronic stock market, trading shares of companies in many different industries, including technology, retail, financial services, communications and biotechnology. In 1896, Dow Jones & Company, a financial publisher, launched what is now known as the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It tracks the stock performance of thirty top U.S. companies, and is considered to be a barometer of the U.S. stock market. So when you hear that either the Dow or the NASDAQ is up or down, it means, in general, that a number of popular stocks are either going up or down in share price. \nIf you’d like to invest in stocks, but you don’t have the time to study individual companies and their stock’s performance, there’s an alternative.

"ZOOS 

People began to keep animals in zoos over 3,000 years ago, when the rulers of China opened an enormous zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In many of the early zoos, animals were taught to perform for the visitors. This no longer happens and it is accepted that the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals behaving naturally. 
Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everybody approves of zoos. People who think that zoos are a good idea say they provide us with the opportunity to learn about the natural world and be close to wild animals. Both of these would not be possible without zoos.

'I actually look rather good in jeans. So I rarely wear them. I don't want to get mixed up with the wrong sort of person.’ So runs the logic of Isabel, 'our heroine’ in this refreshingly zany novel. An art student of 31, devotee of historical romances, she seeks Mr Right but is concerned lest her knobbly knees ruin her chances. Hope, however, springs eternal - which proves to be her salvation, and that of other people in the story. Employing the staccato drama-laden pace of an early silent film, with chapter headings like 'Our Hero Feels Inspired', the author writes with terrific verve.

This is a celebration of the birth and subsequent near-death of a local radio station in America. It is the wry view of a national institution - the wireless - seen through the eyes of a weedy, intelligent child, Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station set up by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to advertise their sandwich bar. Soon the station is beaming out a motley collection of singers, preachers, soap-opera heroes and continuity announcers. This small-town American setting provides the author with huge scope for the dry humour and understated prose for which he is justly praised. He skilfully transports the reader from the present back to the gentler days of the 1940s and 1950s, an era of dime stores, oil-cloth, old-fashioned Ford motor cars and, of course, the wireless.

C.
In the world created by the author, it is quite in order for a second husband to gossip with his wive’s first husband. So, when high-flying professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poetess, he naturally confides in his wive’s ex. The poetess writes rotten poetry, which troubles Richards critical conscience; she’s also trying to get his support for her wrongfully imprisoned brother. However, none of these complications is half as interesting as the way the author untangles them. He moves the plot along with a robust sense of the ridiculous and dissects relationships with perceptive care. It all makes for a highly enjoyable, sophisticated and witty read.

D.
Two sets of best friends - two women, two men - meet in the London of the sixties, and for the next quarter of a century are bound together in life and death. At the outset of this long novel, one of the four, the mysterious American tycoon, James Hudson, is launching a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The launch is crucial, but so is the fact that the woman they both adored (and that one of them married) was killed some years before... Murder, ambition, love and jealousy - it’s all here, and the writing’s good as well. This is one of those books, in size and range, where you can really get to know the characters and be engrossed in them.

"Title: Money is the root of all evil 

In the words of the old song ""Money is the root of evil"" the reality of today's world is revealed. As we can see from the contemporary situation there is a big difference between people who are wealthy and those who exist below the poverty line. The question is, what is better, to be wonderfully wealthy or absolutely poor? In my opinion, there are three main points why money can be called the root of evil. First of all, people who have a lot of money also have power that can be used for bad purposes. Second, people who are very rich feel a constant need for more money which can grow to obsession. Third, people who are rich have to worry about how to protect their money. Therefore, it is better to focus on a different goal in life than money .
 An important point that shows the evilness of money is that people who are rich possess the power over other people which can be used for the bad intentions. First, they may try to use their superiority for bad purposes, for example, corruption. People who have a lot of money may think that they are better than others because of their wealth. Therefore, they can use their money while trying to take a better position in politics. In Lithuania it is quite common to hear about similar cases when wealthy people try to buy themselves a better position. Moreover, there are many cases when rich people pay money to get a permit to do something that is illegal for ordinary people. Second, people who have a lot of money and therefore feel powerful may want to conquer those who have no money. For example rich countries like America or Russia possess large amounts of money and therefore they dictate the rules for the rest of the world. These countries may also want to conquer and appropriate the resources of other countries that can not fight back. Hence, money gives power that, if used for evil intentions, can cause serious problems .
 Another point that proves the words ""money is the root of evil"" is that people who already possess great wealth always seek to get more money. This obsessive need for money can lead them to some troubles. First, wealthy people usually try to increase their income. However, this may be done by violating the rules of law. That is because people who are wealthy feel almighty and think that money can save them from any situation. Second, people who have a lot of money and are always trying to get some more can never feel happy. They feel constant need to increase their income so they forget more important things in life. Such people can not feel happiness because of their obsession. They concentrate on their businesses and therefore neglect their families and friends. Although they are successful in their careers, such people end up lonely and sad because their personal lives are unfulfilled .
 The third point that shows the dark side of money and wealth is that people who are rich have to worry about how to protect their money and therefore they start to feel suspicious about everything. First, rich people may loose their friends because of their paranoia. Such people can not trust anyone and therefore they end up alone and unhappy. Second, because of constant worrying about their wealth, they get stressed and experience many health problems that can even lead to death. Third, people who have no money usually are much happier, because they have nothing to worry about. For example, people who live in the countryside are much more relaxed, because they are constantly surrounded by healthy environment which protects them from unnecessary stress. People from the countryside do not possess great wealth. However, they feel satisfied with what they have .
 In conclusion, all these examples show that money is not key to happiness. On the contrary, money is the root of evil. People who are very rich usually possess power over others that can be used for bad purposes. Moreover, constant need of increasing the amount of money can lead people to obsession and leave them alienated from their families and friends.

"Joanna’s Lessons

Joanna MacGregor has a hectic schedule as a concert pianist. So why has she added the task of writing books for young children learning the piano?

Even a member of that mythical species, the completely tone deaf, could not fail to be stirred by a Joanna MacGregor performance. Simply to see her zipping around a keyboard grabbing fistfuls of notes at the behest of some unfeasible contemporary score is to watch a pianist pushing the human frame to its limits.
But even her dazzling virtuosity was not enough to was one small boy at a recent concert she gave for kids. Like the rest of the audience, he had been cascaded with bits and bobs of pieces in every style from her vast repertoire of classical, jazz, ragtime, blues, techno, African, etc. He’d coolly watched her dive under the lid of the concert grand to pluck the wires - normally a surefire knockout for kids. Then as she drew breath and invited questions, he piped up: ‘Can you play Match of the Day?’
How many veterans of the concert hall platform would be floored by such a request? For Joanna MacGregor, though, it was simply a hoot. ’In his eyes, until I played that, I hadn’t passed the test. I wasn’t a proper pianist.’ Needless to say, she sailed through and doubtless logged the experience for her next children’s recital.
MacGregor is rare among top-flight concert pianists for the interest she takes in how young children learn the instrument. She has just published her own elementary piano tutor for children: Joanna MacGregor’s Piano World. And she has managed it despite a crippling work schedule.
There hardly seems to be a festival this summer she is not gracing. Tomorrow she is in the thick of an all-day collaboration between nine young composers and artists. She runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. And by her own admission, she cannot meet an artist of any sort without being tempted to suggest a joint project. So why on earth take on the extra burden of writing a book?
‘People who know me are clearly surprised. But I think the very first lessons are absolutely crucial. It says a lot about the music profession that we tend to concentrate on the top end, on this idea of the child as nascent virtuoso. Most people’s interest in music is much more ordinary and everyday. I find that far more interesting!’
In producing the first three books, MacGregor is drawing on vivid experience. Between the ages of 18 and 25, before she was getting concert engagements as a pianist, she taught a stream of beginners the piano. But most important in her make-up now as a musician who is unsurpassed in the breadth of her eclectic repertoire was the endless procession of small boys and girls traipsing into her childhood home, where her mother taught the piano.
‘Not only was I fiddling around at the keyboard, but there were all these other children of all backgrounds wanting to play every sort of music - bits of classical, jazz, pop, improvisation. I wasn’t part of that hothouse thing of forcing exceptional talent. I grew up with the idea of trying to make music available to people of all abilities.’
Just as everyone should be able to learn how to swim or to speak a smattering of French, so, in her view, should everybody be able to make a stab at learning the piano. Some kids have a flair and make rapid progress. She is fascinated by the others: those who chug along at varying rates of progress, enjoying it for a while, but all too often giving up. This falling off happens at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too frustrating. Others rebel further down the line when the stakes get higher and parental pressure is driving them ‘to be like those children on the telly.’
‘I worry that some people use music, like sport, as a way of making their children achieve things, rather than just saying: it’s music, it's there to enjoy. The reason children fall by the wayside is because they feel they are not going to match up to their parents' expectations.
The production of her own training manual begs an obvious question. Does she have a poor opinion of the existing corpus of tutor books, or indeed of the general quality of piano teaching? ‘I’m very reluctant to criticise other people’s teaching or others’ tutor books,’ she says. What she does do is readily accept that her books, colourful and eye-catching though they are, are by no means the only books on the market designed to make the first steps enjoyable.
Her own special wheeze for luring these neophytes, the fives, sixes and sevens, through those bewildering times is to weave a storyline into the books and their accompanying CDs. The challenge at this fragile stage is to make the work interesting. And so, from lesson one, there are accompaniments in a variety of styles for teacher - or parent - to play beneath a child’s line. For kids whose parents aren’t pianists the accompaniments are recorded on the CDs. Learning should be unadulterated fun, MacGregor insists.
‘You have to allow them to improvise and give them a reason to play at either end of the keyboard and on the black notes and use the pedals.’ As progress is made, bigger obstacles loom. Children need to be coaxed quite hard to read the music rather than rely on ear. Having relied for so much of her own childhood on her very keen ear, MacGregor has considerable sympathy on this score.
But she believes the single most important factor is practice. How can children be persuaded to play a passage even once again, let alone many times over? She admits to not having practised rigorously until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she began building up a contemporary repertoire whose formidable difficulties demanded practice. Now she loves it. The eight hours a day that she gets through are the core of her musical life, she says, more important than performances.
‘I have enormous sympathy with people who find it difficult. I don’t think people talk about it enough.’ The secret, whether you do it for twenty minutes or five hours, is to work out beforehand what it is you are aiming to do, she says. Other tips: treat yourself - play the whole piece through, however many wrong notes. And mix hard with easy.",C2,"{'title': 'acf825d8-ac0f-47c4-b871-5dafed23c368.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Joanna’s Lessons\n\nJoanna MacGregor has a hectic schedule as a concert pianist.
