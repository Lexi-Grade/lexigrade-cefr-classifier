"Meet the Amazing Watkins Family

The sons are composers and prize-winning musicians, while Dad makes the instruments. Matthew Rye reports.
Whole families of musicians are not exactly rare. However, it is unusual to come across one that includes not only writers and performers of music, but also an instrument maker.
When South Wales schoolteachers John and Hetty Watkins needed to get their ten-year-old son, Paul, a cello to suit his blossoming talents, they baulked at the costs involved. 'We had a look at various dealers and it was obvious it was going to be very expensive,' John says.
'So I wondered if I could actually make one. I discovered that the Welsh School of Instrument Making was not far from where I lived, and I went along for evening classes once a week for about three years.'
'After probably three or four goes with violins and violas, he had a crack at his first cello,' Paul, now 28, adds. 'It turned out really well. He made me another one a bit later, when he'd got the hang of it. And that's the one I used right up until a few months ago.' John has since retired as a teacher to work as a full-time craftsman, and makes up to a dozen violins a year - selling one to the esteemed American player Jaime Laredo was 'the icing on the cake'. Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from an early age. The piano came first: 'As soon as I was big enough to climb up and bang the keys, that's what I did,' Paul remembers. But it wasn't long before the cello beckoned. 'My folks were really quite keen for me to take up the violin, because Dad, who played the viola, used to play chamber music with his mates and they needed another violin to make up a string trio.
I learned it for about six weeks but didn't take to it. But I really took to the character who played the cello in Dad's group. I thought he was a very cool guy when I was six or seven. So he said he'd give me some lessons, and that really started it all off. Later, they suggested that my brother play the violin too, but he would have none of it.'
'My parents were both supportive and relaxed,' Huw says. 'I don't think I would have responded very well to being pushed. And, rather than feeling threatened by Paul's success, I found that I had something to aspire to.' Now 22, he is beginning to make his own mark as a pianist and composer.
Meanwhile, John Watkins' cello has done his elder son proud. With it, Paul won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. Then, at the remarkably youthful age of 20, he was appointed principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, a position he held, still playing his father's instrument, until last year. Now, however, he has acquired a Francesco Rugeri cello, on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 'Dad's not said anything about me moving on, though recently he had the chance to run a bow across the strings of each in turn and had to admit that my new one is quite nice! I think the only thing Dad's doesn't have - and may acquire after about 50-100 years - is the power to project right to the back of large concert halls. It will get richer with age, like my Rugeri, which is already 304 years old.' 
Soon he will be seen on television playing the Rugeri as the soloist in Elgar's Cello Concerto, which forms the heart of the second programme in the new series, Masterworks. 'The well-known performance history doesn't affect the way I play the work,' he says. 'I'm always going to do it my way.' But Paul won't be able to watch himself on television - the same night he is playing at the Cheltenham Festival. Nor will Huw,whose String Quartet is receiving its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall the same evening. John and Hetty will have to be diplomatic - and energetic - if they are to keep track of all their sons' musical activities over the coming weeks.",B2,"{'title': '1.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Meet the Amazing Watkins Family\n\nThe sons are composers and prize-winning musicians, while Dad makes the instruments.

"Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Money - for one a big trouble for another a possibility to buy almost everything. Since it has been established money became a need for all people .
Money is a reward for our work, money can be a theme of a novel or a film, sometimes money is also a scale of somebody's success or station and unfortunately money can be a reason of a crime. You can hate it you can also condemn it but you must have it because you need it. Where is the mistake? In money, man, in human society, in economy or in government? I do not know and I also do not now any solution because I can not imagine a society without money yet - it was only a communistic Utopia. Money is still needed to assess results of human work but I think that society should lead each person to arrange his or her own scale where not money but morale is in the first place, where human life has the greatest value, where love and human honour can not be bought for money .
Money is important in our contemporary society but it is not the most important thing. Who says that money is not weighty he or she is a dreamer. Without money you unfortunately can not buy meals, clothes, books, car, house, flowers or a small thing which makes you pleasant. I thing that money can make one independent. You need not live in a stereotype, you need not be worried about your job, salary, accounts and debts. You can take holiday everywhere, you have much more opportunities how to spend your leisure time. But you can not buy love, health, friends or feelings .
Who affirms that money is the most important thing he or she is an agnistic person without possibility to feel something or believe in something or somebody, he or she became a slave of money and he or she would de everything to have it. People like this exist all over the world. They can kill because of money, they can steal and rob, they sell drubs to young people, they organise prostitution, they do business with arms and weapons, they blackmail others, there is a coruption in this world - this is that evil because of money; Why does it exist? I do not know why but I mean that the evil is not money - this is only reason - the evil is in people .
But I believe that people can overcome it. They have to improve relationships among them, they should regard each other, they should not avoid feelings, they should educated their children in love and in morale and in respect of our life and life of other people, they should teach their children to find the real beauty in small, common, everyday things.

"BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON

Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.,say the police.
Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people have gone out and forgotten to dose a door or a window.
He went on to report that night-time burglaries are unusual because families are usually at home at that time. But he said that winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they can't be seen easily. Also many houses are empty at that time, because people are often still at work.
Inspector Saunders said that it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help to keep burglars away. He also asked neighbours to watch the other houses in the street when people are not at home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 'We will also tell you how to make your house safe,' Inspector Saunders said. 'This kind of help costs nothing.'",A2,"{'title': '10.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'A2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""BURGLARS LOVE THE AFTERNOON\n\nMost house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m.,say the police.\nInspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has gone up by more than 30% compared with last year.

"Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
It has been said before that money is the root of all evil. Surely not all evil is due to money, but the far-reaching harm that is being done to individuals in our world has to be attributed to capitalism. The system has undoubtedly influenced human behaviour at the end of this millennium: capitalism has added greatly to the all encompassing paralysis of the world. This essay focuses not only on the influence of capitalism on the individual, but also on the artist and on art itself .
In the closing years of the 20th century the individual person finds himself surrounded by unnecessary misery and gross inequality. Our community does not take the individuals integrity into account. According to Ludien Goldman, a famous literary critic, it was the so-called new look capitalism that killed the intrinsic value of the individual. When at the beginning of this century the capital concentrated itself around a select number of entrepreneurs, the free trade turned into an economy of monopolies and trusts. In this new economic sustem, the individual had lost its central position. Unlike the 19th century liberalism, the new look capitalism did not allow individuals to take part in big business. As a result, passivity grew .
Consumption is one of the key-words in the capitalists dictionary. People are urged in various ways to buy products that can improve their standard of living, so that after a while those redundant products become indispensable. Riches alone make no man happy, although we live in a world in which wealth seems to be the initial goal of life. Consequently, a lot of people are blinded by the considerations of career and personal profit .
Now how does capitalism affect the artist? The artist, too, is an individual and for that reason has to be protected. He must be given full spatio-temporal freedom to exploit his creativity and genius in order to produce Art. The artist must keep his independency, although he is still part of a society - whether he likes it or not. This society however may not prevent him from expressing his thoughts freely and making hiw own choices .
Theoretically, capitalism gives people this freedom to choose. I have to disagree with this definition. This is the kind of statement that implies that the homeless in e.g. New York City are somehow being homeless of their own volition. In the capitalist system, if you have no money, you have no choice, and capitalism defines freedom as choice .
To conclude this short essay, I'll briefly touch upon the capitalist view of the relationship between art and commerce. I will not discuss the contents of Art. The central simplicity of capitalism is that if something makes a profit then it must be good. This kind of reasoning may do when we talk about hamburgers, or refrigerators, but not when we discuss art. Hundreds of books have been written on the criterions for art, but it is sure that sales potential can never be the sole criterion for art. Therefore I say that capitalism is threatening Art .",C2,"{'title': '096_DBAN3042.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' \n \nIt has been said before that money is the root of all evil.

My uncle looked surprised, but he said nothing and put two bowls on the table.
'Why do you look surprised, Uncle Fraser, when I tell you about the white horse?'
Uncle Fraser sat down. 'There is a legend Megan, of a silvery-white horse. Some people say it is a unicorn.'
'A unicorn!' I said. 'Maybe the horse I saw was a unicorn. It was a long way away and it was difficult to see. What does the legend say?'

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
In USA, Europe, Australia and in Scandinavian, in countries with developed western culture and thinking, woman have achieved a positition that gives her all basic rights as regards to education and study, religious performences and believes, to ways of living and to work and career. Even in some countries legislation gives her preferences to certain political and work positions and statuses just because she is woman .
Besides this achievements, the woman has gained understandness and respect from men, as this is what the women's fight concerns about-the liberation from men's suppression .
This long women struggle to achive equal possibillities in life and living, respect both being a woman and a person is long time ago fullfilled in the western culture. Their faight is over. The feminists work is succeeded and all men agree that they have done a most marvelous and highly nessessary work .
However, we have seen during the two last decades that feminists objectives have turned into extremeties. Equally rights and respect and possibillities are no longer enough. Feminists objectives are now to be superior to men - in all aspects and on all levels. And if they do not fine goals to fight for at home, they find abroad, but fight them from save positions from homeland .
Not long ago I read an interveiw with a nearly fourty year old woman. She worked ver hard and long and ahs given career first priority. However, she sais that he had a man who had given her a child and to whom she was married .
This way of perform life and living, to look upon man's role has become common and fully acceptable today. Man's role is being a fertilizer fullfilling woman's prestige to give birth and prove her womanhood .
More and more women seems to look upon men as a practical object, useful to have at hand when needed for different purposes .
Asking young women today what they features and characters they prefer with a future husbond, they will strongly underline that he must be rich in money, have a good job, a nice house and a fast car, and that he must be kind in the sence that he is very generous to her .
Hard values as money, status and position, etc are today dominent preferences to men .
Looking women today you will observe more and more confirmity with women. Personal identity and individuality are disappering. This confirmities you now can see in women's behavior, dressing, attitude, living and careers, and not least in their personal appearence. It seems to men, very unfortunately that to look like a manis most popular. Sometime even an experienced eye hardly catch the difference, if the person you look at is male or female .
Idealistic struggles when loosing objectives to fight for, too often turns into exstremeties, and so also with the western feminists fights. Objects become more peculiar, and it now seems that the main object is to be superior to men. And to have the slightest possibillities to gain an objective as this, to gain attentions and support, the feminists fighters must exaggerate, and exaggeration leads to vulgarity. Bad behavior and living, swearing, drunkness, drugs, etc, etc, what earlier were men's ""exclusive privileges"" are now fully atapded and accepted by women and seems now more common among women than men. To be bisexual and to perform bisexualities makes you a modern woman and gives you prestige .
From men's point of view the feminists have turned or transformed women into unpersonal objects. It seems to men that modern women are not allowed - or not so free - that she does not dare show that she is a woman, dare not show her femininity. Modern feminism has made femininity something shamefull. Even better under Talibanlike regimes - at least you know that under this dress is a woman .
Maybe men are too romantic. But for more and more western men, the modern feminist struggles and fights and influence on women seems to have killed feminism and where are the feminine women. This kind of feminist behavior and performance make men run away in distress and frustration. Modern feminism will turn back upon the women themselves, as the man will not allow feminists to disturb his nature born basic instincts .
More and more western men turns their back to their native women and look for partners and wifes in other cultures where preferences and values are others, where he feels cared for and where home, children and family still are dominating and most valuables factor for live and living.

"The church was further bolstered in 1563 when another Act of Uniformity made refusal to take the oath, or the defence of papal authority, a treasonable offence. But this time the foreign threat was real: a revolt in 1569, the papal invasion of Ireland, Elizabeth's excommunication and the arrival of priests from France all underlined the insecurity of the Anglican Church. The severity of the Treason Laws increased alongside anti-Catholic sentiment, effectively killing it as any real force by driving it underground for the rest of her reign.

"Amateur Astronomy

Many things have changed in astronomy over the past half-century. Until about 30 years ago, there was a great shortage of charts and catalogues. Telescopic equipment was limited and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, the range of off-the-shelf telescopes and equipment covers almost everything one could need. Electronic calculators and computers have revolutionised almanacs and chart production, and facilitated the analysis of observations and the publication of results.
All this must surely make this the golden age of amateur astronomy. Well, perhaps, but a great deal has been lost as well. Now one may have to travel 80 km to find a sky comparable to that found in urban areas 50 years ago. The daytime skies are now plagued by aircraft condensation trails which can persist for hours and often spread out to form amorphous clouds, making solar observations impossible and hampering night-time observation too.

Too Much Choice

Society is becoming ‘overchoiced’. There are too many things to do, too many options, too many opportunities. In the new economy, the desire for the new product, service or next big thing is an addiction, and technology simply accelerates the pace of change: the noise, the proliferation of new goods and services, offering more and more choice. No sooner has the new product emerged off this virtual production line than the next one is about to be launched. The head spins, the brain races, the fatigue sets in; the disconnection from life begins.
Choice is the mantra of the new economy, but more choice means more stress, less time and more complexity. Hence a new trend is afoot. The search is on for ‘simplexity’ - the simple things that give meaning in an increasingly complex world. But simplifying your life is not easy in an age of economic excess. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we can ever need or want, more software upgrades, features and calling plans than we can keep track of.

McAndrews Hotel

Every summer we spend a fortnight in McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. It is a family tradition, instigated by my grandmother, and by now it has achieved a certain sacredness. Nothing is allowed to interfere with the ritual. We are of a kind, McAndrews clientele: old-fashioned, odd perhaps, some would say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners, the insolence of shop assistants which passes for egalitarianism in this present age; I resent chummy overtures from waiters who sometimes appear to restrain themselves with difficulty from slapping one on the back. I know most of my fellow-guests’ names - like me they have been coming here since they were children - yet can rest assured that when I meet any of them in any part of the hotel, I shall be spared all social intercourse apart from a civil word of greeting.

"Welsh footballing legend John Charles has been honoured in a new set of stamps celebrating 150 years of the Football Association.
The Swansea-born striker and centre-back, who died in 2004, is regarded as one of Wales' greatest players.
He is one of 11 football heroes from Wales, Northern Ireland, England and Scotland to feature on the new stamps.

He then created a composite artwork, so that when the 11 stamps are placed together, they form a traditional team shot.
The 11 players selected were chosen for their outstanding record on the pitch and representation of their home country.
Charles left his home city of Swansea to sign for Leeds at the age of 17 and settled in the city after his football career was over.
He joined Juventus for a then-British-record fee of £65,000 in 1957, winning three championships and the Italian cup in five years at the club.
Charles, known as the Gentle Giant, also played for Cardiff City, Roma, Hereford United, Merthyr Tydfil and represented Wales at the World Cup in Sweden in 1958.
Jonathan Ford, chief executive of the Football Association of Wales, said: ""All football supporters, not just in Wales, will be delighted with the news that John Charles is to be honoured and recognised in this way.

"In September 1533 Anne gave birth to a daughter, Elizabeth (the future Queen Elizabeth I). Henry had grown tired of her, and after two further pregnancies ended in miscarriages, she was arrested in 1536 on trumped up charges of adultery and publicly beheaded at the Tower of London.

"Title: Capital Punishment 
 
All around the world people are punished when they commit crime or do 
something illegal. There are many punishments. One them is capital 
punishment. There are many ways to kill the convicted as Hunter claims in his 
article . -There are many kinds of killing a convicted: Hanging is one. In this 
method death comes quickly. The electric chair is another way. The exact time 
of death is unknown but four to ten minutes is reasonable. Firing squed is 
the most disgusting. The gas chamber takes various minutes of misery agony 
before the convict dies. Lethal injection is another way of killing the 
convicted. When used guillotine, a french invention, death comes rapidly. As 
the last method of killing is stoning which is used in Muslim countries-. No 
human deserves to be killed by any human. Whatever s/he does s/he has right 
to live. governments may have to punish people who commit crime but the 
punishment should not be killing them. In addition to this cost of a capital 
punishment is much more then sentencing a person to life prison. Also life of 
human is given by God and it is right to be killed by God. On the other hand 
some people believe that paople should punished according to the rule ""eye 
for an eye"" but it is very cruel .
In every where people are given capital punishment because of their 
illegal behaviours such as murdering and adultry. However it is not a good 
solution to prevent people doing such things. This is just made because of 
man's blood lust and need for revenge. As [Reference] But killing 
someone is not a human behavior .
People live and may do illegal things through their life but it should not 
mean to lost your life because of your only one wrong behavior because we 
are human and we may make mistakes, we are not God! So all human beings 
deserve to live as [Reference] 
There may be some crimes to be punished severely, but the punishment 
shouldn't be a murder . [Reference] .
The cost of a capital punishment is higher than a life-sentence in prision 
for the government . [Reference] 
Life is a present from God to human. God gave it and God should get 
it . [Reference] 
By giving capital punishment, also the government make a negative effect on 
society as [Reference] 
Another reason not accepting capital punishment is that the person who is 
sentenced may be innocent. A person's life shouldn't be relied on a person's 
words coming from his/her mouth. In countries where capital punishment is 
used, this means that the value of their lives depends on their race and the 
jury's opinion of them .
On the other hand, some people claims to give punishment with the rule 
""eye for an eye"" for the people who commit crime . [Reference] 
Every human has the right to live whatever their crime is. Giving life 
sentence in prison is a good alternative punishment instead of capital 
punishment. Also this punishment (life sentence in prison) much more cheaper 
than capital punishment for the government. In addition to these God has 
given life to human and its His right to take his life away. Nobody can

"Father and son start Gold Rush 

Terence and Chris Madden have travelled from Canada's frozen north to the heat of Africa in their search for nature's most desired metals. The father and son team - one an explorer, the other a mineral expert - believe their mine on the side of a Welsh mountain could contain up to 10,000 ounces of gold. 
After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are convinced that they are just metres away from a five million dollar vein of gold. 'As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to get a few more metres to where it is concentrated,' said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. 
The pair have dedicated their lives to the hunt for gold. Their search began after the father read of pockets of gold worth millions of pounds buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area around the Welsh town of the same name. While reading 19th century mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, father and son chose the most promising area of land to study. 
Since they first cleared away the undergrowth and found bits of gold in the rocks, they have spent the past ten years getting permission for their work from the owners, taking samples of the earth and removing old cars and rubbish. They then set about digging out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to form a tunnel and a 10-metre shaft. 
Now they are running short of money. Having spent their savings chasing their dream, they will have to convince a backer to put £50,000into the project to lower the mine just a few more metres to where the gold lies. Chris Madden says, 'At the moment, this looks doubtful although we've got quite a few people we can contact.' 
As word spread through the valleys last week about the dig, the magic attraction of gold started turning the heads of the inhabitants as well as the gold diggers. Dolgellau relies on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful. 'It would encourage more people to come here if they are right,' said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, 'but if these two find gold I hope millions of people are not going to come and hack away at the hillside.' 
The Welsh gold industry has gone into steep decline since its height in the late 1880s, when thousands were employed in hundreds of mines dotted around the countryside. One of the last remaining mines at Clogau-St David's, which produced wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. 
Now, however, individual gold-diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to drive a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. 'Searching for gold is very emotional,' said Hall, 70. 'It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time.'",B2,"{'title': 'd43e03ee-a07a-426a-8f4b-256b6ef86246.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Father and son start Gold Rush \n\nTerence and Chris Madden have travelled from Canada's frozen north to the heat of Africa in their search for nature's most desired metals.

"Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
If we are to consider the practical application of the knowledge one has gained during one's years in university, the first think that we must consider is the career one has chosen. If this career has to do with scientific research or the profession of a teacher (no matter whether it is a school or university teacher) then the preparation universities offer might be of considerable help .
Otherwise university education does not, as a rule, make young people flexible when it comes to their professional realization .
Although university education tries to give a wither perspective in certain areas of the achievements of human thought and culture, it very often fails to provide suggestions as to how the information received may be used by the individual.

"Title: Mobile phone leads to loneliness

In the course of human history members of different communities have always felt the need for the company of their acquaintances. As time past, technological improvement appeared, mainly from the 20th century, n order to be able to contact with our relations, friends or lovers more easily and quickly. The first of this kind was the telephone and prefebly the mobile phone. However, it has become a tool which unconsciously though, but makes us feel lonely in the most negative sense.
The meaning of the worked loneliness has altered in the last couple of decades. While in the past it meant the time of examining ourselves or fro some being artistic, in the present century the members of a community feel neglected if they cannot contact with somebody by using a technological device called mobile phone. The member of a family tend to priorities talking on the phone to talking to each other. Even the undisturbed family meals have disappeared. Adults and children lose everyday contact because of the phone's presence. They consider telecommunication more important than real private communication. Therefore, the members of the family become lonesome in the world!
In addition to feeling as an outcast in the family, a person can also be abandoned by his or her friends. People get accustomed to be able to call their friends any time in order to tell about every little events which happens. Nevertheless, if something un expected occurs it gives the feeling of ignorance and neglect. In the past it was a natural thing to not to hear from a friend for weeks. Friends wrote long letters to each other. However, friends are obliged to response immediately otherwise the receiver is left lonesome. This person cannot be blamed for this kind of emotion. Not receiving an answer certainly makes one ignored. It is the speed of this communication device which has to be accused of.
Lastly, there is the relationship with our partner which is also effected by the use of mobile phones. Most people would disagree with its negative effects. They consider that it is wonderful to contact with our lover anytime during the day. There is no doubt about its magic especially when a couple is still very much in love. On the other hand, as their relationship progresses it becomes a disturbing factor. Partners talking during the day lose their interest in the other person by the time they meet. If they discuss different issues, beforehand, on the phone there is nothing to talk about personally. It gives the impression of being left alone for ourselves. Moreover, if connection cannot be completed a person feels offended and abandoned. Being in love does not last as long as it did in the past. In old times a woman or a man could remain in love with somebody for even a lifetime. Nowadays, it is impossible. Lovers open to the other opposite sex in a year. as much as they did in ten years time in the past.

"Title: Mobile phone use should be strictly controlled at workplaces.
 
Mobile phones are considered to be one of the most important means of communication, as they facilitate everyday life by making everything easily accessible. Unfettered mobile phone use, however, have several disadvantageous consequences especially at workplaces where the question of restriction is still to be solved. Mobile phone use should be strictly controlled at workplaces by adapting mobile etiquette guidelines, because thoughtless telephoning can draw employees' attention away from work, as well as disturb other employees, and ruin social contacts.
First of all, unrestricted mobile phone use by employees can result in the falling behind with their duties, since those workers who are occupied with making telephone calls and sending or receiving text messages all day long can hardly pay attention to their tasks. Failing to live up to the expectations of their employees, however, might result in losing their job. By the restriction of mobile phone use to a certain number of calls, workers could be obliged to fulfil their duties more efficiently.
Moreover, with their constant telephoning, mobile users might disturb their colleagues as well, thus depriving them of the opportunity to complete that task successfully. The ringing of mobile phones can also be very disturbing during business meetings as well, because they might interrupt the continuous progress of the live conversation.
Disregarding other people's duties can be considered as a highly unethical and selfish behaviour which could only be changed by the imposing of a code of mobile etiquette on the workers
Thirdly, unfettered mobile phone use posesses the power of ringing social contacts, since those who are engrossed with telephoning tend to neglect traditional forms of communication such as one-on-one conversation. Workers usually fail to pay attention to their colleagues because of constant telephoning and thus deprive themselves from the opportunity of effective co-operation. The lack of personal contacts might bad to irreversible consequences such as the alienation of mobile users from their colleagues. This could be prevented by the initiation of a code of mobile etiquette.
Many people claim that mobile phones play such and important role in today's world that the use of them is impossible to be restricted. It should be understood, however, that in certain situations it is inevitable to put barriers before unfettered mobile phone use in order to preserve traditional norms of behaviour. Only by the implementation of etiquette guidelines could selfish behaviour be prevented at workplaces.
In conclusion, although mobile phones has numerous advantages which make their use inevitable in today's world, their spreading and unfettered use should be restricted in certain situations. As the thoughtless use of them might result in unwanted consequences regarding the behaviour of employees and also the atmosphere of the workplace, it should be strictly controlled by a code of mobile etiquette.

To put the member in each role of saying useful statement in the discussion means good teamwork, which leads to better discussion .
Second, to know about the issue is necessary. Persons in the group have each sense of values, which often is influenced by his or her surroundings. So we need to know concrete information in the advance of the discussion. Gathering much info is ideal. And a lot of useful datum can be a good tool to support our opinion .
The last important point is that we should join the discussion more aggressively. If your colleague in need, you should jamp in to support his or her suggestion any time during the discussion. If it is possible, everyday should enjoy their discussion like this. To enjoy the discussion, we at first enjoy speaking English anyway. Feeling that it's not special to talk in English is really good for us, English learner. And It's our essential personal homework for everyday, I think .
On this day, I though over these things, especially the last point, to enjoy speaking English is my next goal of English study. I learned so many English words, easy to difficult, which was washed away after the entrance exam was over. Pathtic. I even now forgetting some words, perhaps. To cope with these problems, we should be always curious about the everything around the English. English TV, radio English program, and so forth. Approaching oneself to English world makes you more interested English speaking .
And this following phase, I am going to explain why I support death penalty. The most important reason is that the person do not have the right to argue his own right to live like normal person. And given such a penalty, a criminal would be checked by us. Thinking another way to do with criminal, there is a life sentence. Some people syas that what the difference of ""death penalty"" and ""life sentence."" Absolutely there is, I think. The person who committed a murder or like that should take on the responsibility. Its responsibility is quite equal to death penalty .
I suppose most people who is against death penalty say this, judgement's dangerous to be a false charge. If we have to do away with a thing which can kill a person by mistake, then we need to do away with car, (there are so many car accidents since it was made by human being.) pistol, (But so many pistols are in America and many countries all over the world.)

"Fun at the Dentist’s?

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a fashionable blue couch which patients sit on while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, 'Fifty per cent of the population only go to the dentist when they're in pain rather than attending for regular check- ups. That's because they're frightened.'
To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. 
That's why I took the decision not to wear a white coat. I find that's one of the things that people associate with pain. In fact, my philosophy is that dental treatment should take place in an atmosphere of relaxation, interest and above all enjoyment.'
Which is all highly shocking for anyone (most of us in fact) who has learnt to associate dental treatment with pain, or at the very least, with formal, clinical visits. Jerome says, ‘If people are relaxed, entertained and correctly treated, they will forget such previous negative experiences.’.
Virtual-reality headsets are one of his new relaxation techniques. ‘We were the first practice in Britain to introduce them and they're proving very popular. The headsets are used for the initial check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I look at their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera, to give the patient a visual tour around their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit to the dentists.
Another key point is that the surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today there is the smell of orange. Jerome explains, ‘When people walk in, I want them to realise with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. That dental smell of surgical spirit can get the heart racing in minutes if you're frightened of dentists.' I certainly found the delicate smell in the surgery very pleasant.
Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist,Jerome is keen to point out that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important but the quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing.
For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. ‘One of the things I found out there was that when you make it easier for the patient you make it easier for yourself’, he explains. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome rushes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he’d like to watch and leads him gently towards the chair. The patient seems to be enjoying this five-star treatment and no wonder. The surgery seems more like an elegant beauty parlour than a mainstream dental practice.",B2,"{'title': 'd7163ae2-11d9-4c8e-8b54-02eb4f5d19e5.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Fun at the Dentist’s?\n\nIf you walk into W.

"Screen Learning

A few days ago I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth while trying to look fierce. 'I'm a little dinosaur,' he said. He was play-acting a scene from a recent TV programme, so I quizzed him about what he remembered about dinosaurs. The answer was, not a lot.
There is a modish rush to embrace internet and computer learning, but is learning via a screen a good method? One writer tells how he tried out an interactive programme with his son. The father diligently read the words while the son fiddled with the pictures. 'Had he spent ten minutes in front of a book, he might possibly have learned something,' said his father.
Television, as my son and his noodles demonstrate, is an impressionistic, suggestive medium. Research about television and learning shows that learning goes on in a learning environment where dialogue is taking place with teachers or parents. It needs to be mediated. There is nothing wrong with harnessing new technology to teach our children, but there is still a big role for formal education.

Hollywood

By 1918, four-fifths of the film-making capacity of the world had relocated to Hollywood. Locals disapproved, seeing their suburb of Los Angeles infected by these new vulgarians. But in the end snobbery yielded to the true American value, success. And success is the box-office gross. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: one that may make a star, but must make somebody's fortune.
In less than a century, Hollywood has grown from a toffee-nosed village to a town as famous as New York, Rome or Paris. And physically, of course, it has changed beyond recognition: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet in a way, it is still a village - parochial, with limited horizons - just a little bit of Los Angeles. For all who live and work in it, there is one topic of conversation - films: how much they have made, who is dating whom, who's been stabbed in the back, who is 'attached' to which project. Those who have been successful often try to get away: to work there, but live somewhere else. Yet it is still the one place in the world to which almost everyone who is anyone in show-business (and plenty who agent) eventually gravitates.

Photography

Photography was invented by nineteenth century artists as an art form for their own purposes. These men were seeking a lasting, literal record of their visual surroundings and they found it. The new combination of illumination, lens, shutter, and flat surface coated with chemicals sensitive to light produced images more lasting, more convincing in their reality, and more richly detailed than painters could produce manually in weeks and months of effort. This alone was enough to throw consternation into the ranks of fellow artists; and, after their first reaction of pleasure in a new kind of image, art critics rallied with the haughty charge that photography was not, and could not be, an art. The actual world in which we live had too strong a grip on photography, they said, and pictures so dependent upon mechanical means could not be called acts of man's creative imagination.
Despite the critics, photographers knew that they had found a new art form, a new mode of expression. They used the new tools as other artists before and after them have used brush and pencil - to interpret the world, to present a vision of nature and its structure as well as the things and the people in it.

Book Illustration

During the black-and-white era of book illustration it was axiomatic that each and every children's book called for some form of illustration. This extended to the large category of novels for the upper reading ages, which was to suffer progressive attrition as print runs shortened. The level of activity in all areas of children's publishing remained considerable, but it was run predominantly as a low-budget operation for most of the period and as such encouraged a fair amount of routine and mediocre work, although the finest artists seldom submitted less than their professional best. Therefore, the black-and-white archive is part junk shop, part treasure house, a wonderful place for research or for browsing, and one in which to make immediate finds or to begin to re-evaluate a fertile artistic period. The real treasures are bound to return to public display, whether enduringly through reissues of individual titles and new publications about the artists who illustrated them - or from time to time in the form of exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that, after a period of neglect, this is starting to happen and the familiar processes of stylistic rehabilitation can be seen to be at work. In due course, an enterprising publisher will doubtlessly see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this period either in facsimile reprint, or in freshly-designed editions using the original artwork where it survives.",C2,"{'title': '2.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Screen Learning\n\nA few days ago I noticed my six-year-old eating noodles in a funny way.

Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one: one that may make a star, but must make somebody's fortune.\nIn less than a century, Hollywood has grown from a toffee-nosed village to a town as famous as New York, Rome or Paris. And physically, of course, it has changed beyond recognition: a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to the village store. Yet in a way, it is still a village - parochial, with limited horizons - just a little bit of Los Angeles. For all who live and work in it, there is one topic of conversation - films: how much they have made, who is dating whom, who's been stabbed in the back, who is 'attached' to which project. Those who have been successful often try to get away: to work there, but live somewhere else. Yet it is still the one place in the world to which almost everyone who is anyone in show-business (and plenty who agent) eventually gravitates.\n\nPhotography\n\nPhotography was invented by nineteenth century artists as an art form for their own purposes. These men were seeking a lasting, literal record of their visual surroundings and they found it. The new combination of illumination, lens, shutter, and flat surface coated with chemicals sensitive to light produced images more lasting, more convincing in their reality, and more richly detailed than painters could produce manually in weeks and months of effort. This alone was enough to throw consternation into the ranks of fellow artists; and, after their first reaction of pleasure in a new kind of image, art critics rallied with the haughty charge that photography was not, and could not be, an art. The actual world in which we live had too strong a grip on photography, they said, and pictures so dependent upon mechanical means could not be called acts of man's creative imagination.\nDespite the critics, photographers knew that they had found a new art form, a new mode of expression. They used the new tools as other artists before and after them have used brush and pencil - to interpret the world, to present a vision of nature and its structure as well as the things and the people in it.\n\nBook Illustration\n\nDuring the black-and-white era of book illustration it was axiomatic that each and every children's book called for some form of illustration. This extended to the large category of novels for the upper reading ages, which was to suffer progressive attrition as print runs shortened. The level of activity in all areas of children's publishing remained considerable, but it was run predominantly as a low-budget operation for most of the period and as such encouraged a fair amount of routine and mediocre work, although the finest artists seldom submitted less than their professional best. Therefore, the black-and-white archive is part junk shop, part treasure house, a wonderful place for research or for browsing, and one in which to make immediate finds or to begin to re-evaluate a fertile artistic period. The real treasures are bound to return to public display, whether enduringly through reissues of individual titles and new publications about the artists who illustrated them - or from time to time in the form of exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that, after a period of neglect, this is starting to happen and the familiar processes of stylistic rehabilitation can be seen to be at work. In due course, an enterprising publisher will doubtlessly see the potential for a series of classic children's book illustrations from this period either in facsimile reprint, or in freshly-designed editions using the original artwork where it survives.\n""}"
"In the nineteen fifties, Britain was a nation in need of men. A decade after the second world war, it was a country with lots of children, but not enough men to work in the mines, the factories and the public services. 
     Hundreds of thousands of young men had been killed during the war; who could take their place? There was an easy answer; men from the colonies! Britain was still the capital of an Empire that stretched to the four corners of the earth. In the developing countries of the Commonwealth, there were millions of young men, just looking for work. When the British authorities offered them the chance to come to Britain and work, thousands wanted to come. 
     Most came without their families; but soon, as they settled into their new country and their new jobs, they paid for their families to come over too. While a few came from Africa, the largest contingent of Black immigrants came from Jamaica and the other islands that make up the West Indies.
      By 1960, ""Afro-Caribbeans"" and their families had settled in large numbers in several of Britain's cities — usually in the poorest and most unattractive parts. At the time however, the conditions they lived in in Britain were not too bad, and often better than those they had enjoyed in the West Indies. There were jobs, so there was money; there were schools for the children. 
     Thus, with its young families, but few teenagers, the Afro-Caribbean community lived quietly beside the White community in cities like London and Wolverhampton, and there was no tension. In reality, the two communities hardly mixed at all.",B2,"{'title': 'text_185.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'In the nineteen fifties, Britain was a nation in need of men.

"Moonshine 

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. 'Here again' is a followup to 'The Waves'. There have been a few changes since the last CD, with Tom Wilcott on bass guitar replacing Simon McVee who left the band last year, and the arrival of Tom Simpson on drums.
It is clear from the first song on the CD which is a dance tune that the band is no longer going to concentrate on slow songs. The second tune is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Most later lacks are in the bands more usual slow style. These two tracks will certainly come as a surprise to many fans. Either of them could easily become a hit single though because they are excellent.
Singer Rob Letchford gets a chance to really show how good he is reaching each note perfectly. Fans should be grateful he recorded the songs for the album before he had trouble with his throat. This has rented in the band having to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets need not worry as dl the concerts will be rearranged as soon as Rob has recovered.)
On this CD Moonshine show they can produce perfect music in a variety of styles from the slow ones we are familiar with to the ones that will keep your feet tapping.

"The dominating factor here are the constituents, who are against having their taxes raised—at least the income, sales, or local property taxes. There are very few issues about which people in a legislator’s district are concerned. According to a recent survey of legislators in five states (Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Vermont and Washington), their constituents had an opinion on about 5 percent of the hundreds of bills on which legislators had to vote in a session. Moreover, during the course of a two-year legislative session, the number of bills on which the constituency had a clear position—with a substantial majority for or against—did not normally exceed 10 and usually was five or fewer.The overwhelming number of issues with which legislators deal, therefore, do not register with constituents. Many issues are too narrow or too technical, and only a handful affect the interests of a sizeable number of people in the district.

"Sea, Ice & Rock

Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books, including Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) began his sea career in the Merchant Navy.
In 1968-9 he was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handed, in his yacht Sunhaili. He broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to reach the Lizard from New York. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, recording the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock.

In 1979 I was working on Quest for Adventure, a study of post-war adventure. I called Robin to ask for an interview and he said would I like to join him for a sail. I could show him some climbing techniques and he could show me the rudiments of sailing.
It was the first time I’d been on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin’s wife and daughter stayed on the boat and we paddled to the shore to exercise Robin’s skills at climbing.
The route was quite difficult and I was impressed at how steady Robin was in tricky conditions. He just padded quietly along. After a bit we I arrived at this huge drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn’t, so I showed him. When I had finished, Robin very politely asked if he could go down the way he climbed down ropes on his boat.
He was used to using his arms, I wanted him to use his legs. I wasn’t too happy about it, but he lowered himself down quite safely. It was during that trip to Skye that Robin and I built the foundation of a very real friendship.
His proposal that we should combine our skills on a joint trip to Greenland was just an extension, on a rather grand scale, of our voyage to Skye. Robin impressed me immensely as a leader. Traditionally, the skipper makes all the decisions.
But Robin made a point of consulting everyone first. Most of the time, nobody dared to advise him, but it was nice to feel you were part of the decision-making process.
To be frank, I found the sailing trying and very boring. The moments of crisis which we had on the way back were easy to deal with: the adrenaline pumps and you get all worked up. The bit I found difficult was spending day after day in the middle of the sea.
I am a land-lover and not really a do-it-yourself type of person. Robin, in contrast, is a natural sailor and seemed to enjoy tinkering with the engine or mending the lavatory. I was aware that Robin didn’t really need me.
To be honest, I felt a bit useless at times; I found that very trying. The crew was also packed very close together: six people on a 32ft yacht, designed to sleep four. At least when you're on a mountain expedition you have a chance to get away from each other.
When we reached Greenland and it was my turn to ‘lead’ the expedition, I found it difficult taking responsibility for Robin’s life. There were many instances climbing together when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me off with him. I had to watch for that constantly. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral — Greenland’s highest mountain - would be.
Robin isn’t a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the pinnacle, we were on the go for 24 hours. On the way down we were dropping asleep on 50 degree slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went to hell and back, but he totally put his confidence in me.
He just followed. When it got too difficult and I realised wed have to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we’d be able to get it through the ice, whether it was in one piece.
Yet he was all in favour of us having another go at climbing the mountain. The only time there was a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking it in turns to be on watch. I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He felt he could do it himself.
The previous night I’d almost dropped asleep. I felt that he didn’t trust me - I felt insecure, and I said so. Robin immediately reassured me that I’d jumped to the wrong conclusion.
While we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn’t really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that underneath his bluff exterior, Robin was a kind-beaned, sensitive person.",C1,"{'title': '950be201-2a76-4720-b987-3fb6338c8e96.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Sea, Ice & Rock\n\nMountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985.

At least when you're on a mountain expedition you have a chance to get away from each other.\nWhen we reached Greenland and it was my turn to ‘lead’ the expedition, I found it difficult taking responsibility for Robin’s life. There were many instances climbing together when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me off with him. I had to watch for that constantly. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral — Greenland’s highest mountain - would be.\nRobin isn’t a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the pinnacle, we were on the go for 24 hours. On the way down we were dropping asleep on 50 degree slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went to hell and back, but he totally put his confidence in me.\nHe just followed. When it got too difficult and I realised wed have to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we’d be able to get it through the ice, whether it was in one piece.\nYet he was all in favour of us having another go at climbing the mountain. The only time there was a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking it in turns to be on watch. I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He felt he could do it himself.\nThe previous night I’d almost dropped asleep. I felt that he didn’t trust me - I felt insecure, and I said so. Robin immediately reassured me that I’d jumped to the wrong conclusion.\nWhile we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn’t really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that underneath his bluff exterior, Robin was a kind-beaned, sensitive person.""}"

"The environment is a rough one, but a most important obstacle democracy faces is that Americans simply do not appreciate what democracy means in practice. In theory, we all revere democracy and support certain principles that underlie it. But we are uncomfortable with the nitty-gritty workings of democracy. It is unappealing to the average eye. 
First, many Americans do not see why there is so much conflict in politics. Research by political scientists has shown that many Americans think that most people agree on basic issues of public policy. So why is there so much fighting in Congress and state legislatures? To some extent people are correct. At a very general level, Americans are in agreement. They want better schools, better health care, and better highways. But there is disagreement over how to achieve these general goals, how to prioritize expenditures, and whether to raise taxes to pay for them. The more specific the issue becomes, the greater the disagreement. It is said that the devil is in the details, and lawmaking is a detailed business. It is easy to believe that most people agree because we live in relatively homogeneous political communities or deal with people who tend to be politically alike.

Still there may be substantial agreement in different communities.

"Keeping the holiday-makers happy

A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners.
This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'lsere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.'
Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7 a.m: to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves to, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says.
By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.'
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted.' 
Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now.
At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m. Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.'
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a chat with friends, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says.",B2,"{'title': '34.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Keeping the holiday-makers happy\n\nA chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners.\nThis is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
This is a claim that is often being made, especially by people who criticize the university system. I agree that university degrees are theoretical, but I think that it does not necessarily mean that they would be of little value in real life. Quite the contrary. I would like to argue that the concentration of theory is actually very useful and valuable, both for the individual and the society in general .
The way I see it, the less theoretical education, say, for example, vocational education, is no more successful in preparing students for ""the real life"" than the more theoretical university education is. The vocational training typically tells the student exactly what to do and how. It gives ready made solutions to problems, so the student who has completed vocational education has not usually learned how to deal with unexpected problems or situations. And as we know things seldom work out the way one expects, and we often find ourselves facing an unexpected problem. The university education, on the other hand, prepares students especially for these unexpected situations. University education encourages students to personal interpretation of situations and individual problem solving. It familiarizes students with different methods and theories, different perspectives and ways of solving problems. It demands the students to be more independent and requires more creativity from the students themselves, than the less theoretical education, and I see these abilities as very important in the real life .
The claim often goes that the vocational education is much better because it prepares students for their specific professions. Some things a university degree might not be able to give us. These might include such routine skills as correct telephone conduct, or how to repair a copy machine, that are needed in most jobs today. Instead of these mechanical skills the university education gives us something much more useful; it enhances our mental capacities and develops our creative problem solving abilities. And is thus, in my opinion, much more useful in the long run. When talking about employment we must also take into consideration the fact university degree is usually a requirement for the top posts, in which case university education is very useful indeed .
In addition to the benefits that university education has in securing high level employment, we must also look at its value to the individual in his private life. The university teaches us to understand various spectra of life more fully, whereas vocational education seldom has opportunities for this. The Finnish university degree in particular gives us both all-round education, and a deeper and more detailed understanding of one or two fields. When we study at university level we learn the know-how of collecting information, processing and analysing it. We learn how to theorize, and how to perceive larger structures behind the fractured information that is being poured to us. We are able to examine information critically, to question things and not accept them at face value. A person who has gone through the vocational education system does not have these tools at his use. Therefore he may sometimes feel that he the real life does not make any sense to him, and feelings of alienation might result from this .
A further example of how university education prepares us for the real life, and how it is beneficial, is the fact that educated people tend to be more active in the society, by belonging to different organisations and voting actively. Due to their educational background these individuals realise their potential of making their voice heard, and that they really can influence decision making in the society. So university education is actually very valuable from the society's point of view as well, and not merely from the individual's .",C2,"{'title': '110_FIHE1022.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world.

"Couffignal is a two-hour ride from San Francisco. It is not a large island, and is joined to the mainland by a wooden bridge. Its western shore is a high, straight cliff that comes up out of Pablo Bay. From the top of the cliff the island slopes eastward to a beach, where there are piers and pleasure boats.
Couffignal's main street has the usual bank, hotel, movie theater and stores, but there are also trees and lawns, and no ugly flashing signs. The buildings seem to belong beside one another, as if they had been designed by the same person.
The streets that cross the main street run between rows of neat cottages near the bottom of the slope, but higher up the houses are larger and further apart. Most of the owners of these houses are rich, well-fed old men who will spend what is left of their lives nursing their health among their own kind. They admit to the island only as many storekeepers and working people as are needed to keep them comfortably served.
That is Couffignal.

"Holiday reading

Summer promises us two of life's great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are, of course, intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match. What was shy and confused within us is unapologetically and cogently phrased in them, a congruence all the more striking if the work was written by someone in a far-flung place or in another age. We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place: except perhaps during our reading of a great book, which guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about. 

Author's Note

These travel reflections were all published as articles in the Observer newspaper over a seven-year period. Here and there I have restored some small cuts by the editor, which had to be made if the piece was to fit the page, but otherwise I have added very little. The occasional outright howler has been corrected, but only if it was a matter of detail which I should have got right in the first place. Hindsight would have allowed further improvements, but there would have been no end to the process. In the second article about China, for example, it seemed likely at the time, and for some time after, that the Hong Kong dollar would hold up. A year later it fell. If I were to rewrite the piece so as to predict this fact, it would become a claim to prescience, or at any rate no longer a report written at that moment. But like any other flying visitor, in South East Asia or anywhere else, I was there at that moment, ignorant as to what would happen next, and fully occupied with making the most elementary sense of what had happened already. That has been the real story of mass jet travel: the world opening up to people who have no qualifications for exploring it except the price of a ticket. But I have never been able to believe that all my fellow travellers were quite blind. Even a postcard can be written with a purpose.

Ecotourism

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been hijacked, diluted and misused, then 'ecotourism' would earn top prize. The term first surfaced in the early 1980s, reflecting a surge in environmental awareness and a realisation by tour operators that many travellers wanted to believe their presence abroad would not have a negative impact. It rapidly became the hottest marketing tag a holiday could carry.
These days the ecotourism label has broadened out to cover anything from a two-week tour living with remote tribes, to a one-hour motor boat trip through an Australian gorge. In fact, any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty spots, wildlife or a dash of soft adventure is likely to be included in the overflowing ecotourism folder. There is no doubt the original motives behind the movement were honourable attempts to provide a way for those who cared to make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a standard industry definition left many travellers lost in an ecotourism jungle.

Transylvanian Journey

The notebook covering the Transylvanian leg of my journey was lost for 50 years, and only restored a few years ago by a great stroke of luck. It has been a great help to me in reconstructing that period and committing it to print, but not the unfailing prop it should have been. For in Transylvania I found myself having a much easier time of it than I had planned, drifting from one hospitable country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I came to a standstill during those long halts, writing stopped too; as I was keeping a journal of travel, I wrongly thought there was nothing to record. I was often slow to take it up again when I moved on and, even then, jotted notes sometimes took the place of sustained narrative.
Fearing some details might have got out of sequence when I started writing the present book, I surrounded these passages with a cloud of provisos and hedged bets. Then the thought that these pages were not a guidebook persuaded me that it didn't matter very much, so I let the story tell itself free of debilitating caveats.",C2,"{'title': '62.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Holiday reading\n\nSummer promises us two of life's great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are, of course, intimately connected.

"Observing Lions

In the popular imagination, lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset, a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey. The lions seem to be archetypal social animals, rising above petty dissension to work together towards a common goal - in this case, their next meal. But after spending many years observing these creatures in the wild, we have acquired a less exalted view. 
When we started our research in 1978, we hoped to discover why lions teamed up to hunt, rear cubs and among other things, scare off rivals with chorused roars. If the ultimate success of an animals behaviour is measured by its lifetime production of surviving offspring, then cooperation does not necessarily pay: if an animal is too generous, its companions benefit at its expense. Why, then, did not the evolutionary rules of genetic self-interest seem to apply to lions?
We confidently assumed that we would be able to resolve that issue in two to three years. But lions are supremely adept at doing nothing. To the list of inert noble gases, including krypton, argon and neon, we would add lion. Thus it has taken a variety of research measures to uncover clues about the cats behaviour. Because wild lions can live up to 18 years, the answers to our questions are only now becoming clear. 

Pop Music Review

The release of Bedrock’s third album was more than just a landmark in the career of a talented but hitherto precarious band. New Life launched a movement that effectively redesigned the specification of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Out went the earnest angst, plain-shirted drabness and overdriven guitars of a previous era; in came a lighter blend of melodious homegrown styles. A mix of social observation and strident anger mingled easily here with the sound of fairground organs and northern brass bands. Humour and irony were well to the fore, as were the voices that felt no need to disguise their origins.
The album showed Bedrock to be skilful magpie collectors and observers, and a cunningly versatile team of songwriters. At their most obvious, they went larkily after traditional English preoccupations such as sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. But the album’s real strength lay in the gentle melancholy depths it plumbed on tracks such as ‘So Low’, a gorgeous unfurling tune loosely hung around the theme of meteorology, and ‘To the Brink’, a ballad that allowed no smirking at the back. The beauty of New Life is its consistently sky-high quality - 16 tracks with absolutely no filler remains an unsurpassed record in the era of loiteringly long CDs.

Extract from an autobiography

As a child I was always fascinated by stories of ‘The Sibyl’, those mysteriously wise women who wielded such influence in the ancient world. To begin with, I only knew of the existence of one who appeared in a tale my mother had told me. An old woman of Cumae offered Tarquin, King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused and she burnt three of them, offering him six for the same price. When he refused, she again burnt three books. He bought the remaining three for the full 300 gold pieces. 
I realised even then that there was a profound truth hidden in the story - a lesson in salesmanship and in life. I was sometimes a lonely only child. I used to ask to play with other children and be refused. My mother told me to do something so interesting that all the other kids would beg to join me. It worked. It was another lesson that I’ve never forgotten.
When I was given the chance to write a travel book, I had to look for something that I could bear to find out about, something that was relevant to my life. I’m a reluctant traveller - at the first opportunity I sent my editor a very long list of places I wasn’t prepared to go to. When it comes down to it, I’m only interested in ruins, because the travel I like is the travel of the mind through time.

What becomes of your manuscript?

When you submit your manuscript it will most likely join a heap waiting for someone to sort and sift before it topples over - the so-called slush pile. The someone is usually either the editorial department junior (i.e. under 18) or an old hand who comes in a couple of mornings a week and is paid by the hour. Neither of these has much influence, but they are basically on your side and out to discover something original - the junior to make his or her name and acquire an author of their own if they are lucky, the old hand to justify continuing freelance employment.
If they think your novel is promising, they will pass it on to a more senior editor and eventually it will surface at an acquisition meeting. The championing editor will not only have to justify accepting your novel on the grounds of intrinsic merit and potential sales, but also say whether you as an author seem to be a long-term prospect (which you will have assured them of in your letter). Also the question is raised of how promotable you are likely to be - an important factor - when a new novel needs all the help it can get. To this end, publishers often like to meet a potential author before clinching the offer.",C2,"{'title': '3daee402-c532-4d9c-8ca2-a9c77bdfdd30.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Observing Lions\n\nIn the popular imagination, lions hunting for food present a marvel of group choreography: in the dying light of sunset, a band of stealthy cats springs forth from the shadows like trained assassins and surrounds its unsuspecting prey.

"Careless tourists scar ancient alpine rock art 

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers fear that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so [line 6: beginning] rapidly that they will not survive for future generations. [line 6: end]
The mountain, believed to have once been a site for prayer and worship, is scattered with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. They include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti. 
Jean Clottes is the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art. He says, 'People think that because the pictures have been there so long they will always continue to be there. But if the damage continues at this rate there will be nothing left in 50 years.' 
He describes seeing tourists stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors, he says, even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs. 
'When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture: he said. 'The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and the visitors can't see them properly they simply rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.' 
Other researchers describe how people arrive carrying long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings,or even their names, in the rocks. 
But experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings.Henry de Lumley,director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Otherwise, he says,not only will the site be completely destroyed but important research work will be reduced. 
Clottes disagrees. 'The measure proposed by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring about protests from people who live there,’ he said. 'The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.’
David Lavergne,the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. 'Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,’ he said. 'Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is financial. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. There seems to be no prospect of government funding.’ 
In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is alarmed that as the mountain becomes easier to reach - tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles - the damage will increase rapidly.She thinks that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides.'You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money: she said. 'That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site.

When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976 my only object was to earn enough to feed my children. Today 'The Body Shop' is an international company rapidly growing all around the world. In the years since we began I have learned a lot. Much of what I have learned will be found in this book, for I believe that we, as a company, have something worth saying about how to run a successful business without giving up what we really believe in.
It's not a normal business book, nor is it just about my life. The message is that to succeed in business you have to be different. Business can be fun, a business can be run with love and it can do good. In business, as in life, I need to enjoy myself, to have a feeling of family and to feel excited by the unexpected. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way.
Now this book sends these ideas of mine out into the world, makes them public. I'd like to think there are no limits to our 'family', no limits to what can be done. I find that an exciting thought. I hope you do, too.",B1,"{'title': 'b44998eb-736d-4b7f-89aa-55ed80f55f04.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""No Title\n\nWhen I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976 my only object was to earn enough to feed my children.

"Issue: You must decide whether to support a bill to increase the tax on a package of cigarettes by 25 cents. 
Merits of the case: The main arguments for increasing the tax are as follows.  First, the state is facing a budget deficit, and without additional revenues cuts will have to be made in a number of programs. Second, an increased price will discourage some people—and especially teenagers—from smoking. The main arguments for opposing a tax increase are as follows. First, cigarettes are now taxed at $2.00 per pack. Second, an additional tax is an unfair burden for those who choose to smoke. Third, higher cigarette prices will further encourage smuggling and the illegal sale of cheaper, untaxed cigarettes. 
Interest groups: The Tobacco Institute, supported by a number of tobacco companies, oppose the tax. The institute contributed $500 to your last campaign.

"Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

	Everybody has the right to live in a safe society. Sometimes, this safety is under the threat by those who break the law. These criminals are responsible, so they must meet the consequences of their actions and this happens by putting them in jail. Some people believe that by punishing inmates, we can prevent them from committing more crimes, while others believe that we have to put all efforts to reform them. In fact, we should make a balance between controlling and reforming them.
	Many people think that the first and foremost justification for prisons is mere punishment. I believe they say so because punishment can be the easier solution in hand, this can be also because we have the habit of punishing even in our daily life. If a child misbehaves, her mom or caretaker punishes her for her wrong deed. Instead of thinking in depth and finding the reason behind her action they threat the child to punish her, and the degree of punishment varies according to her action. For sure, punishment can reduce wrong deeds, but for sometimes. In this case, the child will find the courage, because she has tasted the punishment and she is not scared anymore. Punishment alone may not be enough. Not all behaviors are changeable through punishment. So, the point here is that if we punish criminals, our community can be protected in a short run, but how about the long run?
	Some other people believe that prisons should be a place to rehabilitate. Rehabilitation means providing therapy and education classes for prisoners in hope that they experience a normal life in future. This is great, but not everyone wishes to be rehabilitated. It all depends on the individual's decision, whether he wants to change or not. Since we are not aware of their motives for doing the crime, rehabilitation can get even harder. Based on all these things, if the criminal justice system spends huge amounts of money and time and energy on prisoners, that would be a waste.
	In fact, I do believe that punishment and rehabilitation should be seen as complementary. Our purpose for imprisoning inmates must be punishing them in the first place, but more importantly, making sure that this is helping them to behave like a normal person in their society. By punishing, I do not mean treating them inhumanly. In fact, criminals should be treated in a way that we expect them to treat when they are released in future. They should receive care and respect, so that they will be able to give them to others. If we segregate them from society to punish them, they will explode and commit more crimes when they come out of jail. To me, reform does not mean taking it easy on prisoners. They should not receive leniency; instead, they must do long hours of hard work with no payment. There must be tough rules and desciplines. Inmates must be aware that everything has a pay off. At the same time, there must be therapy classes to provide an opportunity to change the way they think and act and stop them from committing further crimes. Therefore, based on what stated, combining punishment and rehabilitation can be the most effective strategy that the criminal justice system can use.",C1,"{'title': '220_IRMA07036.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals.

I HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn't have any summers. I went out to New Zealand every summer here, which is the New Zealand winter, and so I had nine winters on the trot, which was great, because I like winter.
My parents came up with this idea of buying a small plot of land which 'the kids', my brother, sister and I, could look after. Mother said, 'If you can take the time and trouble to plant it with trees then you can have it.' The idea was that we would always have a stake in New Zealand, which is a lovely idea as my father was actually brought up there. And they found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. It's rather poor land, really, but it's quite good for planting trees on.
I've always been very keen and enthusiastic about land. I'd spent a year in Australia working on sheep stations and helping out in different farming jobs, and so the idea of planting trees sounded like a very nice idea, and I was immediately keen. I think the rest of the family got enthusiastic as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972 between the three of us we'd planted the whole 70 acres.
In New Zealand in 1968 it was one of those winters. It rained an awful lot, endlessly in fact, and in a way it's idiotic to think back on it as such an immensely happy time as it rained pretty well most days that we were planting, and I don't suppose I've ever been wetter or colder for such a prolonged period.
There was a moment of truth every morning: getting ready for the next planting session. Coming out of the Land Rover relatively warm and dry, with the rain coming down, and your anorak still clammy from the day before, boots still sodden, hands fumbling with slippery laces.
'The brain begins to take over and to allow for all sorts of strange thoughts, ideas and reflections about life.'
In that first year I had a guy to work with me who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful as I'd never planted trees seriously before all this. You have a planting bag around your neck which you fill with as many trees as you possibly can, and when your bag is full it's a nightmare, and it's only as it gets lighter that life gets easier.
In a way, the most difficult bit of the entire operation was getting the lines straight. You work out what spacing you're going to plant the trees at, and then you line up a series of three poles across as long a trajectory as you can get, and those poles then determine your lines. Once you're in line, you just plant all the way down the line till you get to the end, turn around and come back again. I enjoy hard physical work, and it certainly made me fit.
After a certain point you can plant trees almost on automatic, you become used to a rhythm, and you use the minimum number of spade strokes that you need to get the hole in the ground. The rhythm is something that everybody tells you about and, of course, it's true of many agricultural jobs that you actually have to train the body into a series of quite standardised moves, and then it becomes immensely easy: so you develop an absolutely regular process of taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, putting it in the ground, stamping it in, and moving on. Mentally, it's very interesting. The brain begins to take over and to allow for all sorts of strange thoughts and ideas and reflections about life - a lot of my thinking about the natural world and our place in it, all of those things that have since dominated my life, first began to pop through my head in those days.
I've been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees gradually grow, which has been very satisfying when you actually planted the things and you do then have a kind of stake in what happens and how they prosper.
I always dread reading in the newspapers stories of another high wind in New Zealand, or Worst Drought Ever Hits New Zealand. Such headlines make me feel extremely apprehensive. However, it worked out extremely well and those trees are now 20 years old, and in good fettle.
The only postscript I should add is that I took a term off from teaching, and I went back there in 1984, completely on my own for three months. And I wrote my first book there, Seeing Green. There's a little cabin on the tree farm which is fantastically basic, just a bed, a table and a chair. In the mornings I would do my writing; in the afternoons I would go off and prune the trees, and then do research in the evenings.
The connection between me and that area is still immensely strong. In many respects it's the place that I feel most closely identified with in terms of that link between people and the earth: it's a most powerful bond.",C1,"{'title': '3.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""With the trees, I planted my stake in New Zealand\n\nJONATHON PORRITT\n\nTALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER\n\nJonallum Porritt is the author of Seeing Green - The Politics ofEcology'.\nI HAD a most peculiar period of my life when I didn't have any summers.

"Once a select forum of the great and good, the Technology Entertainment and Design (TED) conference now has millions of avid online fans. How did an elite ideas-sharing gathering go mainstream?
Falling animals, misbehaving toddlers and footage of Justin Bieber may populate the bulk of any YouTube most-viewed list.
But amid the viral clips and pop music promos is a series of videos that seems to go against all received wisdom about what online audiences like to consume.
Their tone is sunnily optimistic, go-getting, Californian, with titles like Information Is Food, Crowdsource Your Health and Inventing Is the Easy Part.
They feature luminaries such as Stephen Hawking, JK Rowling and Bono delivering 18-minute lectures about big ideas - technology, culture, the environment, science, social trends.
Yet although there is nary a Lolcat in sight, the YouTube channel of the Technology Entertainment and Design (TED) conference has attracted nearly 112 million views.
The talks have a habit of catching on. TED attendees were given a preview of Al Gore's lecture on climate change lecture, later popularised in An Inconvenient Truth . Biologist Richard Dawkins' 2002 lecture on ""militant atheism"" laid the groundwork for the arguments set out in hishugely controversial book The God Delusion 
Others have entered the realms of the downright strange, such as whenMicrosoft founder Bill Gates unleashed live mosquitoes into the auditorium during a talk on malaria because ""there's no reason why only poor people should have the experience"" (the insects were not infected).

"When Andrew Jackson was a little boy he lived with his mother in South
Carolina. He was eight years old when he heard about the ride of Paul
Revere and the famous fight at Lexington.

It was then that the long war, called the Revolutionary War, began.
The king's soldiers were sent into every part of the country. The
people called them the British. Some called them ""red-coats.""

There was much fighting; and several great battles took place between
the British and the Americans.

At last Charleston, in South Carolina, was taken by the British. Andrew
Jackson was then a tall white-haired boy, thirteen years old.

""I am going to help drive those red-coated British out of the country,""
he said to his mother.

Then, without another word, he mounted his brother's little farm horse
and rode away. He was not old enough to be a soldier, but he could be
a scout--and a good scout he was.

He was very tall--as tall as a man. He was not afraid of anything. He
was strong and ready for every duty.

One day as he was riding through the woods, some British soldiers saw
him. They quickly surrounded him and made him their prisoner.

""Come with us,"" they said, ""and we will teach you that the king's
soldiers are not to be trifled with.""

They took him to the British camp.

""What is your name, young rebel?"" said the British captain.

""Andy Jackson.""

""Well, Andy Jackson, get down here and clean the mud from my boots.""

Andrew's gray eyes blazed as he stood up straight and proud before the
haughty captain.

""Sir,"" he said, ""I am a prisoner of war, and demand to be treated as
such.""",B1,"{'title': 'text_134.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'When Andrew Jackson was a little boy he lived with his mother in South\nCarolina.

"Title: In the words of the old song ""Money is the root of all evil"". Agree or disagree? 

We live in a world where everything seems to be revolving around money and making money. Industries and businesses are flourishing at an unprecedented rate, and we seem to be losing ourselves in this vicious circle of making more and more profit. Our society has become industrialised and materialistic to an extent that has never been seen before, people are judged or appreciated depending on how rich they are. Although money is necessary for most essential things in life, I strongly believe that it is money that in fact is the root of all evil, or at least, the root of most of it .
Money makes the world go round they say, and this is a fact well known nowadays. It is essential for everyday life, we need it for clothes, food, hygene, to begin with the small things, but also rent, bills, gas, and similar expenses. But money has much more power than to just be used for mere expenses of our daily life. Money is the fuel which makes numerous great things possible, such as all sorts of cures for illnesses, materials for technological equipment, medical equipment, different research projects and experiments which may change the world in the future. And although they say that you can't buy the most important things in life such as love, happiness or health, the sad truth is that if you are well-positioned in society you will have more friends, be able to afford more things and also be more likely to be healthy since you will have the option to choose healthier options in your alimentation, because we all know how pricey eating healthy can be. And, bottom line, if you happen to get ill, you need money for medication or in the worst case a surgery, so if you wanted you would be able to choose a better medical institution to go to than the state hospital .
However, in spite of all the perks of money, I strongly believe that it is the money and wealth that are the causes of world's biggest evils. Starting with ignorance, far from me saying that wealthy people are ignorant, but some of them set a very bad example for their children by giving them too much freedom and no responsibilities. This we can see in various examples, such as the ""Rich Kids of Tehran"" profile on Instagram which first came to my mind. They show off their wealth, their collections of gold watches, the piles of dollar bills, the luxurious cars and mansions, but what they don't show off is class, modesty or knowledge. They grow up to be pompous daddy-sons and daughters and few of them become scientists, explorers, writers, or contribute in any way to their society, and that is just the ignorance which money causes. It causes far worse things, and one of them is pollution. Our environment is getting more and more polluted and industry is becoming more and more developed nevertheless. The ozone layer is ruined, the climate is changing and all most people care about is not losing money. The air and water are severely polluted, but all we see is more cars and more ships. Where this will lead our future generations, we are yet to see. But the worst thing that money causes is war. Were it not for money, would there be nuclear weapons, or any other kind of weapons with the power to destroy the entire planet? Hardly. Greed in itself is not sufficient anymore, you need money to make anything possible, especially war. The saddest thing is that human lives have become to be valued through money and if a soldier dies in war, his family will receive a certain amount of money for their loss .
We live in a modern age where everything and anything is possible, and it is possible thanks to money. We see all the grand shiny things money has made possible, but few of us will actually think of what we've lost because of money. And we've lost a lot. Should we continue following this path, soon enough we will lose ourselves .",C2,"{'title': '414_SEBG2050.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: In the words of the old song ""Money is the root of all evil"".

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
The society we live in establish patterns which well-succeed people should follow, otherwise they seem impossible to reach. People have to work, to study, to go to the supermarket, to pay the bills and at the same time, they have to be the most efficacious professional, the kindest parents, the most regardful spouse and so on. Moreover, all these stuff has to be often changed, updated and renewed. For women, these obligations can be a little more stressful. In the past, women could fulfill all professional requirements when they got to the market. In some cases, as they were considered inferior, these new workers had to be better than the average. Unfortunately, prejudice brought this behavior to current days. Nowadays, .many women have shown a unbelievable efficiency in order to keep their posts, especially the chief posts. Moreover the conquer of the right of having a carrier did not liberated women from the housewifery duties. These unrewarded job can be as tiring as their profession or even more than it. As a soften policy to ease up all these pressure, the Brazilian government allows women retire five years before man . 
Despite of all these efforts, another question comes up: the woman's role in kids education. Many kids are brought up currently without constant presence of their parents. Absence in fathers case is acceptable because most of the fathers role is to provide family. However there is a belief in which the absence of the mother could be harmful for children. Mothers absence should not be connected to lack of affection. Carrier does not overcome mothers role therefore, it does not destroy the link between mother and child. Even because only the quality of the free time both spend together can measure the strength of this link. In many cases, this is a really hard chore, because lots of women have to provide their kids by themselves. In fact, what is really harmful for kids is lack of attention from mother and from father due to their unsubstitutable role in growth and education . 
Beliefs like these are part of a great range of concepts which comes in and goes out throughout minds that constitute our society. Sexism is a kind of prejudice which is neither too weak to be ignored nor too strong to complaint about it. Prejudice does not favor women or men, both just have to deal with the limitations it puts in their lives. Thus, female behavior and beauty patterns, that are practically impossible to follow, are everywhere. Maybe, nobody can get rid of the judgements that can be made based on them. They can make a woman lose her job, her marriage and sometimes, her health if she did not fit in the exigencies of these patterns, which demands on extreme beauty and eternal youth. Thus far, to things can happen: some women just get depressed while others submit themselves to plastic surgeries, treatments, diets that not rarely put their health in danger. Everything in order to follow an unwise pattern of beauty and behavior . 
Probably, women obey these patterns lead by the education they received before, which sometimes sustain focus on obeying and submission. Young girls growth is plot in a imaginary world in does not incentive the development of decisions or the ways to solve problems. They are just made to believe the charming prince will come and save the princess then all problems are solved. At the same time, boys are brought up with different point of views, such as make decisions and take the control of the situation. Notwithstanding the fact that nowadays, kids are having more wise kinds of education a lot of concepts about education related to boys and girls should be revised . 
An individual item that really deserves to be revised are the laws related to abortion in Brazil. Illegal and bad-succeed abortion is related to the main cause of dying of poor women in the northern state of Bahia. In So Paulo it takes the third place. The Brazilian health system and laws gives a woman all the support if she wants to get pregnant and have this baby. However, if she does not want have this baby due to a great range of reasons, her rights just end up left in the lurch. Then, she might apply herself to become part of the figures shown before .

People said it looked like a whale.
""It was 300 feet long!""

"Castro married Mirtha Diaz Balart de Nunez, a fellow student and the daughter of a prominent Cuban politician.
Mirtha’s family disapproved of Castro’s radical politics, but still paid for his honeymoon in the US. The following year they had a son Fidel Ángel – ‘Fidelito’. Their marriage came under strain because Mirtha’s family had close ties with Fulgencio Batista, the powerful right-wing military general and former president.
Castro was crushed when his mentor Chibás shot himself in the stomach during a radio broadcast in August 1951 and died 11 days later.
Castro started studying the ideas of Karl Marx as he sought a political solution to Cuba’s deep problems. In 1952 he ran as an independent candidate for the Cuban congress. That March his plans for a political career were thwarted when Batista re-seized power in military coup. Seeing scores of his close comrades murdered by the oppressive regime, Castro lost faith in democracy – and was set on a path towards armed revolution.
In 1952 Castro and his younger brother Raúl formed an underground revolutionary organisation and began military training.
The following year, Castro led a rising against Batista. About 140 rebels attacked a federal garrison at Moncada, Santiago. They were outnumbered and forced to retreat. Many of the rebels were executed, but the Castro brothers were imprisoned.

"The collapse of the Soviet Union threw the Cuban economy into chaos. But Castro was adamant his Cuba would survive.
Cuba lost around $6bn in annual subsidy from the Soviet Union and could no longer export sugar in exchange for its oil – Cuba’s factories and agriculture were paralysed. Fidel Castro was forced to improvise. He introduced stricter food rationing and opened up the Cuban economy to limited private enterprise, especially in tourism. In 1999, Castro’s ally Hugo Chavez took power in Venezuela and in 2000 Castro signed a deal – sending thousands of doctors in exchange for oil.
Cuban refugees continued to escape Castro’s Cuba. In 1999, Elián González, a five-year-old Cuban boy was rescued from the sea and brought to the US.
The boy was the sole survivor after his mother drowned when their boat capsized. In an intense legal battle Cuban Americans fought to keep Elián in the US, while his father pressed for his return. Castro led the protest marches in Havana. In 2000 Elian returned to Cuba and Castro made him a poster boy of the revolution. Despite his advancing years, Castro kept a grip on power – in 2003 in what would be dubbed the ‘Black Spring’, he imprisoned 75 people in a crackdown on dissidents.
In January, the US sent 20 suspected al-Qaeda members from Afghanistan to the detention camp in Cuba. By November 2002, there were 750 detainees.
In 2003, Castro blasted the US for running what he called a ’concentration camp’ on Cuban soil. The US has maintained a naval base in Guantanamo Bay since 1903 – leasing the area from successive Cuban governments for $4,085 a year.

"Under Sarah's Spell
Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist whose paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality. Here she is interviewed by Joanna Watt
There cannot he many artists who l10 not sign their work unless they are asked to. Sarah Janson, a trompe-l'oeil artist, is one. She is not remotely interested in the concept
of the artist as creator, let alone that of the artist as genius: 'It's not the artist
who is important, but the work,' she states. Janson is so self-deprecating that she would almost like you to believe that her trompe-l'oeil works paint themselves.
All of which does not bode well for a magazine interview. 'I just don't like to shout about myself,' she says, and then covers her face in horror when asked if she minds being photographed for the feature, Cut to her sitting room 30 minutes later (a wonderful space in a Hock of artists' studios in London, filled with paintings and drawings) and you find two women bent double with hysteria. Her confidence gained, the interview becomes a fascinating, amusing (and sometimes hilarious) encounter.
Janson has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years, after two years' solid drawing at art school ('the best training any artist can ever have'}, a degree in graphic illustration and a stint at a publishing house. But illustration never really satisfied her, and she joined a specialist decorator, Jim Smart ('one of the best in his day'). Smart asked her to do one trompe-l’oeil, and that was it. 'Suddenly my interest got channelled,' she says, She left to set up on her own, 'not really knowing where I was going, hut feeling that I was on the road to somewhere.' Her instinct was right.
Janson’s observational skills and fascination with detail (gained through illustrating) proved essential qualities for a trompe-l'oeil artist. 'People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation.' She insists (in that self-deprecating way) that she is still learning. 'The moment you think that you've mastered a field you might as well give up.’ She is also brutally honest about her 'failings' ('I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete') and is frank about her mathematical abilities. Faced with a huge commission for the domed chapel ceiling at Lulworth Castle, she became totally confused when calculating measurements. ‘I thought to myself, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you
think you are?”’ This habit of self-questioning and a reluctance to openly acknowledge her skills has spawned an oddly distanced attitude to her talent. Janson often speaks in the third person: ‘When I finished that ceiling, I thought, “Well I didn’t do it, she did”.’
Of course, her trompe-l'oeil schemes can speak for themselves. Janson's work is in a league of its own, far above those who have jumped on the bandwagon (the art of trompe-l'oeil has experienced something of a revival, hut not with entirely satisfactory results) and she has a string of major corporate and private commissions behind her. Much of her work is inspired by architecture or made for architectural settings. There is the trompe-l'oeil dining room for one client, based on the facade of a Venetian palazzo, and the painting at the end of a corridor in a Hat, which gives the illusion that you can step into two further rooms.
There is always a danger with trompe-l'oeil, though, that once you get the joke, your attention is lost, something of which Janson is acutely aware. 'Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and then engage your imagination. That is the most important part.'
While trompe-l'oeil has to be clever, it must also, Janson believes, be personal to the client. 'I love the interaction with clients; hat is where the ideas arc horn,' she says. 'Without the rapport, the job of creating a trompe-l'oeil scheme becomes rather difficult. Some clients have firm ideas about what they want; others do not. You have to he willing to listen. You have to get inside a client's imagination.' Many have become friends, nut least because Janson practically lives with them if she works on site.
Janson is generous in praise of her clients. 'I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls.' she confesses. And, they too, seem delighted with her, which is why she is constantly busy - despite her inclination to play down her talent. 'I really don't like to shout about myself,' she repeats at the end. 'Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout.' True, perhaps, hut you could never really become bored with Janson or her work. It certainly deserves to become better known, and I am prepared to incur her wrath while I blow her trumpet.",C1,"{'title': '06b03351-bec8-4479-ae87-018f3aaaf17f.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Under Sarah\'s Spell\nSarah Janson is a trompe-l\'oeil artist whose paintings are designed to deceive the eye by creating the illusion of reality.

"Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 
	
	First, I want to define some definitions that are necessary to know First, criminal according to Oxford Advanced English Dictionary Criminal offence is an act that is harmful not only to some individual, but also to the community. Such acts are forbidden and punishable by law if a person happens to do a criminal offence he would become a prisoner. Based on Merriam Webster Dictionary a prisoner, also known as an inmate, is a person who is deprived of liberty against their will; this is the second. Now about the topic of this essay we should know that; many individuals believe that rehabilitation is one of the major purposes of the prison, but why should the rehabilitation happen in prison and not in other communities? It is widely believed that the prison system is outdated and no civilized society should punish its criminals, it should rehabilitate them. We should know that some criminals choose the prison as a place for learning crimes rather than for avoiding crimes, and after they became free they continue their crimes .

	Lack of legal educational programs, teaching job skills would result in uneducated individuals who are more interested in taking the risk of doing crime. And also some of them, are who try to follow their leads. Leaders in prison are mostly those who are more intelligent than others, and sometimes their punishment is lifelong prisoner. These people have great influence on others, and they should not encourage them to do so . 
	They should define rehabilitation as a way to help somebody to return to a normal life by providing therapy which would prevent prisoner from having a desire to go back to prisons but actually they do not do this. They encourage and teach them new criminal . 
	Actually the leader of the prison or someone who is responsible for the prison must doing something for them. Government and public could run some communities to teach these prisoners rather than to punish them, and I heard that they established some workshops and they taught them some works like: wood carving, painting and something like this, but some criminals did not work, and I totally agree with this idea because when they come back from prison they can work for themselves and make a new life for them selves and their family. another thing about their families is that when they are in jail their families have not a good life with out them .
The bad reality about them is that their families left them a lone .
	Another important thing in my idea is about some prisoners who are debtor; I think that they should have another place. they should not be in a place that dangerous criminal are there. They should have a special place because I think they do not do crime, and I think government is responsible for this, and they should rehabilitate this rule and provide a special location for them .
	The other thing is about the youngsters who are in prison I think the rules that refer to them must rehabilitate. Because some of them are actually innocent. Some of them became assassin because of doing a foolish work in a moment they lose their control and they kill some body. That is not true they wait till they become eighteen to gallows, when they are in prison in this time they do not have any hope for their future lives or about others who are in prison for stealing. I think they are whom that have problems in their lives and with their families. Most of them have not parent, And have not a good family to support them, and they grow in ruin places with criminals that they teach them stealing from people and begging in streets or selling some goods .

	I think government should do something for this problem they can provide a suitable place for this child that they can have a real life with a suitable place for sleep, for education and they plane for their future time that is their right like other children .
	I believe the laws about this children should rehabilitate, and about the votes commanded by a arbiters need some changes .
I heard that in one city in our country a judge commanded a interesting vote about two boys that killed a rare animal in forest, this judge said to this boys that they should write an essay about animals and environment instead of going to prison .

"The Vienna Assignment

I was in Vienna to take photographs. That was generally the reason I was anywhere then. Photographs were more than my livelihood. They were part of my life. The way light fell on a surface never failed to tug at my imagination. The way one picture, a single snapshot, could capture the essence of a time and place, a city, a human being, was embedded in my consciousness.
One day, one second, I might close the shutter on the perfect photograph. There was always the chance, so long as there was film in my camera. Finish one, load another, and keep looking, with eyes wide open. That was my code. Had been for a long time.
I’d come close once, when some weird aptness in the knotted shape of a smoke plume from a burning oil well made my picture the one newspapers and magazines all over the world suddenly wanted. Brief glory from an even briefer moment. Just luck, really. But they say you make your own - the bad as well as the good.
I went freelance after that, which should have been a clever move and would probably have worked out that way, but for life beyond the lens taking a few wrong turnings. The mid-nineties weren’t quite the string of triumphs I’d foreseen when my defining image made it to the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I was in Vienna, rather than anywhere even faintly newsworthy.
But, still, I was taking photographs. And I was being paid to do it. It didn’t sound bad to me. The assignment was actually a piece of happenstance. I’d done the London shots for a glossy coffee-table picture book: Four Cities in Four Seasons - London, Paris, Rome, Vienna, a European co-publishing venture that netted me a juicy commission to hang round moody locations in my home city in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I’d given my own particular slant to daffodils in Hyde Park and heat haze and traffic fumes in Piccadilly.
I’d also reconciled myself to the best and truest of what I’d delivered being tossed aside. It was, after all, only a picture book. It wasn’t meant to challenge anyone's preconceptions or make them see instead of look.
It was just after an obliging cold snap over Christmas and New Year that I handed in my London-in-winter batch and got the message that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had walked out on the job in Vienna for reasons nobody seemed to think I needed to know about. Rather than call in someone new, they offered me the substitute’s role.
The Austrian publishers had liked what they'd seen of my stuff, apparently. Besides, I was free, whereas the French and Italian photographers weren't. And I was glad to go. Things at home weren’t great. They were a long way short of that. A week snapping snowy Vienna didn’t have to be dressed up as a compliment to my artistry for me to go like a shot.
They put me up at the Europa, on Neuer Markt, in the heart of the old city. I’d last been to Vienna for a long weekend with my wife: a midsummer tourist scramble round just about every palace and museum in the joint. It had been hot, hectic and none too memorable. I hadn’t even taken many photographs. On my own, in a cold hard January, it was going to be different, though.
I knew that the moment I climbed off the shuttle bus from the airport and let my eyes and brain absorb the pinky-grey dome of light over the snow-sugared roofs of the city. I was going to enjoy myself here. I was going to take some great pictures.
The first day I didn’t even try. I rode the trams round the Ringstrasse, getting on and off as I pleased to sample the moods of the place. The weather was set, frozen like the vast baroque remnants of the redundant empire that had laid the city out. I hadn't seen what Schussner had done with spring, summer or autumn. I hadn’t wanted to.
This was going to be my Vienna, not his. And it was going to give itself to me. I just had to let it come. A photograph is a moment. But you have to wait for the moment to arrive. So I bided my time and looked and looked until I could see clearly. And then I was ready.
Next morning, I was out at dawn. Snow flurries overnight meant Stephansplatz would be virginally white as well as virtually deserted. I hadn’t figured out how to cope with the cathedral in one shot. Its spire stretched like a giraffe's neck into the silver-grey sky, but at ground level it was elephantine, squatting massively in the centre of the city. Probably there was no way to do it. I’d have to settle for something partial. In that weather, at that time, it could still be magical. But then, there’s always been something magical about photography.
It certainly seemed that way to the nineteenth-century pioneers, before the chemistry of it was properly understood. Pictures develop and strengthen and hold by an agency of their own. You can stand in a darkened room and watch a blank sheet of paper become a photograph.
And even when you know why it happens you don’t lose the sense of its mystery. That stays with you for ever. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning failed in some strange way to surprise me.",C2,"{'title': '275b907e-8600-47e0-b00c-cae5577e1afd.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""The Vienna Assignment\n\nI was in Vienna to take photographs.

It was, after all, only a picture book. It wasn’t meant to challenge anyone's preconceptions or make them see instead of look.\nIt was just after an obliging cold snap over Christmas and New Year that I handed in my London-in-winter batch and got the message that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had walked out on the job in Vienna for reasons nobody seemed to think I needed to know about. Rather than call in someone new, they offered me the substitute’s role.\nThe Austrian publishers had liked what they'd seen of my stuff, apparently. Besides, I was free, whereas the French and Italian photographers weren't. And I was glad to go. Things at home weren’t great. They were a long way short of that. A week snapping snowy Vienna didn’t have to be dressed up as a compliment to my artistry for me to go like a shot.\nThey put me up at the Europa, on Neuer Markt, in the heart of the old city. I’d last been to Vienna for a long weekend with my wife: a midsummer tourist scramble round just about every palace and museum in the joint. It had been hot, hectic and none too memorable. I hadn’t even taken many photographs. On my own, in a cold hard January, it was going to be different, though.\nI knew that the moment I climbed off the shuttle bus from the airport and let my eyes and brain absorb the pinky-grey dome of light over the snow-sugared roofs of the city. I was going to enjoy myself here. I was going to take some great pictures.\nThe first day I didn’t even try. I rode the trams round the Ringstrasse, getting on and off as I pleased to sample the moods of the place. The weather was set, frozen like the vast baroque remnants of the redundant empire that had laid the city out. I hadn't seen what Schussner had done with spring, summer or autumn. I hadn’t wanted to.\nThis was going to be my Vienna, not his. And it was going to give itself to me. I just had to let it come. A photograph is a moment. But you have to wait for the moment to arrive. So I bided my time and looked and looked until I could see clearly. And then I was ready.\nNext morning, I was out at dawn. Snow flurries overnight meant Stephansplatz would be virginally white as well as virtually deserted. I hadn’t figured out how to cope with the cathedral in one shot. Its spire stretched like a giraffe's neck into the silver-grey sky, but at ground level it was elephantine, squatting massively in the centre of the city. Probably there was no way to do it. I’d have to settle for something partial. In that weather, at that time, it could still be magical. But then, there’s always been something magical about photography.\nIt certainly seemed that way to the nineteenth-century pioneers, before the chemistry of it was properly understood. Pictures develop and strengthen and hold by an agency of their own. You can stand in a darkened room and watch a blank sheet of paper become a photograph.\nAnd even when you know why it happens you don’t lose the sense of its mystery. That stays with you for ever. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning failed in some strange way to surprise me.""}"

"Great sports

Women on a winning streak

To excel in any sport is hard enough, even far men, but women have to be twice as tough. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, so sacrifices must be made. But against all the odds they are beating prejudice and breaking records. Here, we talk to just a haw brilliant British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. Jill, 27, skier

""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land cleanly, but it can be scary. Sometimes you don't feel well or it's windy and you can't see, but you just get on with it. It's not easy to have a career outside skiing because we train for ten months of the year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends. But it was my choice. There are six men and three women in the British team. We all compete on the same courses at the same competitions and get treated the same - it's a young sport.""

B. Caroline, 22, cyclist

""Two years ago I borrowed a bike to take part in a charity race. I won overall just because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing because I'd never cycled before! I'm well paid as a pro, and cycling has lots of potential in terms of endorsements. However, I know I'm not ugly and it worries me that people may think I've got where I am because of how I look, not because I'm the best cyclist. So I tend to concentrate on the cycling at the moment, rather than earning money I do at least four hours' training every day on the bike, plus some stretching exercises, swimming and running.
My boyfriend's a cyclist as well, so he knows the time you have to put into it -- it would be impossible otherwise.""

C. Annabel, 26, rower

""Rowing is hard for girls to get into because very few girls' schools do it. So most don't start till they're 19 or 20 which makes it harder to succeed at an international level. Also, you usually have coaches who only stay a year or so. There's no continuity so the women's squad is basically a shambles. But it's great fun and I love being fit, plus there's a good social life.""

D. Ffyona, 24, long distance walker

""At 13 I dreamed of walking around the world -- I didn't know just how big it was then! But Britain was too claustrophobic, too safe. I was very headstrong; I hated anyone having control over me. Now I am more tactful. Each walk has been different.
The walk across Australia was the worst experience I've ever had as far as pain is concerned. I was doing 50 miles and 21 hours each day with three hours sleep in high temperatures and walking with 15 blisters on each foot. But I got the record! I had to, because my sponsorship money was going to run out after 95 days. Men think that women are more likely to fail, so sponsoring them is always seen as a higher risk.""

E. Lisa, 26, saloon car racer

""Some men have huge egos when they're driving - you see it on motorways. When I'm doing well, they don't talk to me. Being a woman has its disadvantages.
When I get to a corner, the men think 'I've got to beat her', so I've had a lot of knocks!
You have to be naturally competitive and aggressive. It's very difficult to earn any money and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the twenties and have always been classed as eccentrics. It's great that there are now more and more women taking up racing every year. For me, the appeal of saloon car racing is aiming for perfection always trying to get round with a perfect lap.""

F. Alison, 28, triathlete

""I get up at 5.30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on my sleep. In the evening I just cycle or run. Yes, I do fall asleep at my desk sometimes! There is a lot of nervous build-up beforehand and when you're racing you really push yourself - you don't feel good if you don't. Several times I've asked myself why I do it. The answer is a) I'm happier when I keep fit, b) I'm a slob at heart and if I didn't make myself do this I'd really be one, c) racing is very social.
Men and women usually compete together but when an event is given coverage in the press, 90 per cent of the article will explain the men's event and 10 per cent will say, 'Oh, by the way, so-and-so won the women's event'. The prize money isn't as good either, of course. But now we've formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission, so we're working on it.""",C1,"{'title': '25.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Great sports\n\nWomen on a winning streak\n\nTo excel in any sport is hard enough, even far men, but women have to be twice as tough.

"Title: Money is the root of all evil 

Nowadays it seems that money is the most important thing in peoples' lives. The world became very materialistic, people seem to live to make and spend money. Madonna once said - ""We are living in a material world and I am a material girl"" and this truly reflects our society. Money means different things to different people: to some it is freedom, to others - nice things, to third - freedom, but the most important thing about money is the power, which is so desirable. The aim of this essay is to prove that words from old song ""Money is the root of all evil"" are true .

Firstly, money took over peoples' feelings. The world is full of rich men and women who are lost spiritually. Often seems that for most people money are more important than friendship, love or even family. People seem to forget what true things in the world are. People betray their family and friends for money, they lie, grovel; they are ready to sell their principles and themselves for money. Often young girls dream to marry a millionaire, preferably an old one, and get all his money when he dies. This shows how materialistic people are: they can sell themselves and also desire someone to die. People betray their principles, believes for money. Probably most people would sell their votes or take a bribe if there was an opportunity. When people get rich they often forget their friends, all true values in their lives. They become arrogant, snobbish, and associate only with people of high status in society. Another problem is that the human being is boundless and greedy. When he gets rich, he wants to become even richer and when he becomes richer he wants to become richer than that .

Secondly, all crimes happen because of the money. It seems that people can do anything to get money. They are ready to sell drugs, steal, sell people or even kill. Often when you want to get money, you have to take them away from someone. It is easier to get rich by stealing or selling drugs on streets than working legally all your life. Policemen and judges break laws by taking bribes. There is a problem of bribes in Lithuania in hospitals also. Money can cause such catastrophes as wars also. Wars happen most often because of the lands and profitable things like oil, gas and so on. Millions of people die just because of someone's desire to get enormously rich and powerful .

On the other hand, money cannot perform actions on itself. Money is just a tool. It is not the money, but people and their desire to be rich, get the status in society, power, is evil. That is why ""The love of the money is the root of all evil"" is the more correct form .

To conclude, the words from the old song ""Money is the root of all evil"" are true. Money causes a lot of bad things in the world nowadays. Because of the money and desire to get rich, people forget the true values: feelings like love, loyalty; their friends, family and principles, believes. People are very materialistic and they are ready to do anything in order to be rich and get some higher social status. Moreover, after they get rich they forget their friends and become greedy. What is more, all crimes, evil is being done because of the money. Money causes even such catastrophes as wars, where millions of people die. As money itself do not do harm to people, but people who wants to get rich and powerful are actually evil, more correct form of statement about money could be - ""The love of the money is the root of all evil"".",B1,"{'title': '301_LTVY4024.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Money is the root of all evil \n\nNowadays it seems that money is the most important thing in peoples\' lives.

"Looking after the countryside 

THE NATIONAL TRUST 

The National Trust is an organisation whose aim is to conserve the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to one of the wardens employed by the Trust to look after the beautiful areas it owns. 

Common sense. That's what a National Trust Warden needs, according to Gareth Roberts. 'And you definitely need to be good at handling people, because you're continually dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists and building firms.' 
Gareth was born and bred on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he married. About 80 people applied for the post as National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience won him the job, despite his lack of formal training. 
'I find it particularly helpful that I still farm with my parents and that I can deal with farmers on the same level and be aware of their problems. Also, they can't take me in about anything!' he says. His farming life also means he is well able to cope with the physical demands of the job - erecting fences, planting trees, building walls. 
Since he has been with the Trust, Gareth says he has come to understand more about nature conservation. 'When I was a youngster,' he recalls, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae and old birds' nests. And I thought to myself recently, where would I find all those flowers, the birds' nests, the grasshoppers now? It's really become clear to me that farming has affected the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault - they were just doing what the government told them.' 
Gareth says that, when he started his job, farmers and conservationists were set against each other. Both sides wanted things done their way.Now they are talking and can see each other's point of view. 'We're at the crossroads and there's just a small step needed to join them together,' says Gareth. 
Conservation is one of the main aspects of Gareth's work, along with public entry to the Trust's land, tree planting and maintenance, and meeting the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My role is to make sure jobs get finished, with as little fuss and as economically as possible. What I enjoy most is seeing projects completed, although about half my time is spent on reports, signing bills and so on.'

Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to one of the wardens employed by the Trust to look after the beautiful areas it owns. \n\nCommon sense. That's what a National Trust Warden needs, according to Gareth Roberts. 'And you definitely need to be good at handling people, because you're continually dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists and building firms.' \nGareth was born and bred on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he married. About 80 people applied for the post as National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience won him the job, despite his lack of formal training. \n'I find it particularly helpful that I still farm with my parents and that I can deal with farmers on the same level and be aware of their problems. Also, they can't take me in about anything!' he says. His farming life also means he is well able to cope with the physical demands of the job - erecting fences, planting trees, building walls. \nSince he has been with the Trust, Gareth says he has come to understand more about nature conservation. 'When I was a youngster,' he recalls, 'I used to pick and press flowers, collect butterfly larvae and old birds' nests. And I thought to myself recently, where would I find all those flowers, the birds' nests, the grasshoppers now? It's really become clear to me that farming has affected the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault - they were just doing what the government told them.' \nGareth says that, when he started his job, farmers and conservationists were set against each other. Both sides wanted things done their way.Now they are talking and can see each other's point of view. 'We're at the crossroads and there's just a small step needed to join them together,' says Gareth. \nConservation is one of the main aspects of Gareth's work, along with public entry to the Trust's land, tree planting and maintenance, and meeting the Trust's tenant farmers. 'My role is to make sure jobs get finished, with as little fuss and as economically as possible. What I enjoy most is seeing projects completed, although about half my time is spent on reports, signing bills and so on.' \nGareth is certainly keen on his job and despite never being off duty, he obviously enjoys every minute of his work, especially talking to the public. Most of them, anyway. 'It's the attitude of some people I dislike,' he admits. 'They just walk into the area, demand everything, then walk out again as if it's their absolute right.

"Kinetic Art

Rejoice -- the well-nigh impossible has happened: London's austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder. And not, thankfully, by some huge-budget, mega-hyped, multi-media extravaganza, but by a charmingly idiosyncratic investigation into an almost forgotten aspect of the last 60 years. A new exhibition traces the history of kinetic art -- that is art which is concerned with movement -- in the twentieth century. In the process, it reveals that making artworks which either move by themselves or investigate the idea of movement in some way has been a consistent if largely unrecognised theme of some of the most fascinating creative activity of this century. And not only that -- the marvellous range of paintings and drawings, documents and films on kinetic art assembled by curator Guy Brett, who has made a life-long study of the subject, are presented largely unmediated by text. Visitors, unharried by explanations, are left to have the pleasure of making connections and discoveries for themselves.

David Hockney

Hockney's work appeals to a great many people who might otherwise display little interest in art. It may be that they are attracted to it because it is figurative and, therefore, easily accessible on one level, or because the subject matter of leisure and exorcism provides an escape from the mundanities of everyday life. Perhaps it is not even the art that interests some people, but Hockney's engaging personality and the verbal wit that makes him such good copy for the newspapers. He may, in other words, be popular for the wrong reasons. But does this negate the possibility that his art has a serious sense of purpose?
In the view of some respected critics, Hockney is nothing more than an overrated minor artist. To this one can counter that Hockney might seem minor because it is unacceptable today to be so popular, rather than because his work is lacking in substance. Hockney himself is not self-deluding; he is aware of his limitations and thinks that it is beside the point to dismiss his work because it does not measure up to an abstract concept of greatness. Hockney does not claim to be a great artist and is aware that only posterity can form a final judgement on his stature.

Window-shopping - an art exhibition

In the last few years I have seen loads of exhibitions of contemporary art, and amongst them brilliance and mediocrity. What always bugs me, though, are shows that seem to push an underlying agenda, suggesting there is a common attitude among certain artists. Sometimes it works, we really are made aware of new trends mining though apparently unrelated work. More often, though, we are alerted to a dubious angle or a forced concept. This led me, as a curator, to attempt a show which stands as an antithesis to this.
Together with seven artists I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was intended as a collection of individual artworks that related to each other purely through the fact that they proclaimed to be art. Sam Cole's knitted cats went barmy chasing each other round on a toy train track. In contrast Matthew Crawley's turning on a video camera, opening it up and poking around in there until it breaks flickered, flashed and disappeared on the monitor in the corner. These works certainly didn't fit into the 'an exhibition exploring the theme of ...' category, and wouldn't usually be seen together in the same show, but why not? They did not impede each other and actually, I hope, through their contrast, gave something to each other. OK, so I haven't made any grandiose statements about the nature of contemporary art practice, but there probably aren't any to be made about what is basically an individual activity in which artists set their own parameters.

Art History

People who enjoy paintings are sometimes reluctant to analyse them for fear of spoiling the richness and spontaneity of their experience. It has been suggested that some of the work done by art historians, whose concern is with theory rather than practice, ignores and indeed denies the aesthetic experience, the fundamental pleasure of looking, as well as the very special act of artistic creativity. This view is a bit like the notion that knowing the ingredients of the recipe, recognising the method of cooking and seeing the utensils employed detracts from the taste of the dish.
Acknowledging the importance of enjoying something does not, of course, preclude a thorough knowledge of the object that is arousing pleasure. It might in fact be more pleasurable if we know more about the object we are viewing. Moreover, pleasure is not a simple matter. The arousal of our senses - and how we recognise and register it - is itself open to interrogation. It is also historically located. Why we like particular characteristics of certain sorts of objects at any one time is not simply the result of our genes or our own particular personalities but is determined by values promoted within the society of which we are a part. So, while no one seeks to underestimate the importance of sensuous and instinctive responses to art objects, the notion that the sensuous is undermined by the intellectual is a legacy from a period in the past which promoted art as an alternative to thought.",C2,"{'title': '50.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Kinetic Art\n\nRejoice -- the well-nigh impossible has happened: London's austere Hayward Gallery has been transformed into a place full of wonder.

But acquiring English in the native country is not easy. Some learners of English have difficulty in learning English before they reach proficient level. Then what are the most important factors in successful language learning? It's not intelligence and aptitude. Some individuals have an exceptional aptitude for language learning. But I think that the answer is motivation and attitude. High levels of motivation and positive attitude are correlated with success in language acquisition. And successful learning enhances motivation. I believe that .
The principal way that teachers can influence students' motivation is by making the classroom a supportive environment in which students are stimulated, engaged in activities which are appropriate to their age, interests, and English level. And most important thing is that students can experience success. So English teachers need to devise their classes to make interesting and effective classes so that their students can be interested in English and progress their English well .
How class is interesting and effective for students? It's a student-centered class. Some English teachers don't give their students many opportunities to speak in English. In English class, teacher should not be a center of the class and should give students many opportunities to use English as much as possible. And it's important for teachers to make a good atmosphere that all students can speak their opinions or thoughts freely .
When I was a high school student, all English teachers taught us in Japanese. They hardly spoke English except for reading textbook. And they applied traditional method like a grammar translation. The focus was on the language itself, rather than on information which is carried by the language. The teachers' goal was to see to it that students learned the vocabulary and grammatical rules of English. And the goal of students, including me, was to pass an entrance examination for university rather than to use English for daily communicative interaction. So I guess that most of the students couldn't speak English well .
I think that English teachers should teach in English. I, of course, want to teach in English. The English class in the high school (and junior high school) is only place where students can learn useful English. Many students go to a supplementary private school and study English but the taught things there are only grammar and the way to get good score in English examination or test. So English teachers in high school have to teach more practical English .
In many school, the most widely applied method is no doubt the grammar translation method. But this teaching method is inadequate for English acquisition. I think that teachers should many opportunities to engage in conversational interactions in group and paired activities. These activities will be able to lead to increased fluency and the ability to manage conversations in English .
I heard the news that new school where focuses English would be established in Kanto soon. In the school, other subjects will be taught in English. The number of such the school may increase in future. English teachers will need higher English skills to teach. I will study hard and contribute to students' English learning as an English teacher.",B2,"{'title': '248_JPSW3003.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: How English Should Be Taught \n \nToday English is widely used among many people in the world.

"Keeping the holiday-makers happy

A chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. 

This is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex. Known by her nickname, Pilch, Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in the wooden houses, known as chalets, that are characteristic of the area. Sarah graduated in French and History of Art from Oxford Brookes University last summer. 
Being a chalet girl isn't a career, she says, but an enjoyable way to spend a year or two before settling down. 'It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week.' 
Sarah does not 'live in'. She gets up at 7a.m. to walk the mile or so to the chalet, which sleeps up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing that of the guests. 'They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit and croissants.' When the last of the guests has had breakfast, by about 9.30 a.m., Sarah clears up and either makes the afternoon tea, which is left for the guests to help themselves, or cleans the rooms - 'the worst part of the job,' she says. 
By about 11 a.m. she is ready to go on the slopes herself. She skis as much as possible. 'On a good day we can be up there until 4.30 p.m.' Sarah returns to the chalet in time to prepare dinner and takes a shower before doing so, but does not sleep. 'It's fatal if you do,' she says. 
Dinner, a three-course affair, is served at 8 p.m. and coffee is usually on the table by 10 p.m. Sarah clears away the dinner things and fills the dishwasher. 'There's nothing worse than coming in to a messy kitchen the next morning.' Sometimes she will stay and chat with the guests, other times they are content to be left alone. 'Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks, for whatever reason, don't go quite so well.' 
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives - and they go out at about 11 p.m. 'We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,' she says. But Sarah never stays out too late on Saturday night as Sunday is her busiest time of the week. 'A frightful day,' she says, 'when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast with a terrible headache.' 
Work begins earlier than usual on Sunday, since breakfast for guests who are leaving has to be on the table by 7 a.m. As soon as the guests are gone, Sarah starts cleaning madly. 'We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, get everything ready.' If she hasn't already done the week's shop on Saturday, Sarah does it now. 
At around 3 p.m., the cleaning work done, Sarah then prepares tea for the new guests. 'They get here at around 4.30 p.m.' Sometimes they are disorientated and full of questions. I'm sure it's the mountain air that does something to them.' 
Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests needing boots or skis down to the ski shop and then gets a lift back to the chalet from one of the ski shop staff. It is soon time for dinner duty again and perhaps a drink later, but not always. 'Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,' she says.",B2,"{'title': '67.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Keeping the holiday-makers happy\n\nA chalet girl's work is never done, Sarah Sutherland-Pilch tells Veronica Lee - in between making beds and delicious dinners. \n\nThis is the second year as a chalet girl for Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex.

"Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
A long time ago, a family, or even a whole village, gathered at night to spend their evenings together after a hard day's work. They made music and danced; they told stories and the children played games. When it got dark, everyone (or almost everyone) went to sleep to get a good night's rest before starting another day's work early in the morning. In the winter people didn't go out very much; they spent the evenings close to the fireside, the women knitting and sewing, the men smoking their pipes or carving a toy out of wood .
When electric light was invented, people tended to stay at home more often and to stay up later. They took advantage of the fact that they could enjoy the light as long as they wanted. They still spent the evenings in family, but started doing other things: playing cards or other party games, reading a book or the paper if they could read, listening to the radio when that was invented, etc... People in the villages tended to spend less and less time in each other's company, and in the cities this situation was even worse (because cities are more often than not, less social than cosy little villages).
When television was invented and the greater part of the population could afford it, it got to be a new and very easy way to entertain oneself: after a hard day's work in a factory or somewhere else, most people were too tired to do anything and it was very easy to just sit down, put your feet up and let someone turn on the telly .
That is when television industry started producing all kinds of series and shows that would go down easily and that don't ask for a lot of effort on the part of the public. This practice started in America (like many other things, good or bad, do) and spread around the world. And it continues up to this very day, except for the fact that it has all become even more sophisticated and less primitive in a lot of areas .
An incredible number of soap series, some more successful than others, have been created with the sole purpose of entertaining people. Some of these series are of a higher quality than oters, but these aren't always the most successful ones; they often don't last longer than one season .
Almost every single one of these series is based on the same ideas: a group of people, mostly a family, in a particular place, and a number of problems and intrigues, very often because of love affairs or money, that these people have to deal with .
The remarkable thing is that most people don't seem to get sick and tired of seeing the same things happening over and over again. But then again, most people love to stick their nose in other people's affairs, and that is exactly what they can do in those series .
Soap series and game shows seem to appeal to all people all over the world. Even in Third World countries, where people hardly ahve any money, they often have a television set, even if only one for a whole village. And you can then see those people, gathered in a hut, very attentively watching ' Dallas' or ' Dynasty ' or another flashy, glamorous series that the country's television company could buy cheaply. It nevertheless seems a bit illogical and ironic that those people seem to be able to afford a television set and at the same time have got almost nothing to eat .
In short, nowadays many people spend their evenings in front of their television set, without talking(=communicating) at all. And if there still is someone who dares to comment upon something that happens on TV, he/she is told to 'shut up, I am trying to watch that film!'

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Feminism is a phenomenon, which together with television, cinema, numerous flights into the space characterises our crazy 20th century .
Feminism, what is it actually? It is the struggle of women for their rights the dictionary informs us. So at first sight there is no harm in it. Let's have a brief look at the history of its development .
The end of the 19th century - women are bored and tired of sitting at home, knitting, washing , bringing their children up and waiting for their husbands who spend all their time at offices earning for the living. It is not a very cheerful picture, is it? And who will judge poor women for their innocent desire to vary their monotonous lives a little?
What do we observe now, just several decades later? Women study at universities together with men, they wear the same clothes, take an active part in politics, they go in for sports, they even fly into the space .
They are likely to have achieved everything they dreamed about .
But amazingly they do not stop. They dug deeper and found things which they called "" discrimination "" and "" sexism"".
A man opens a door before a woman and she is insulted. She can do it herself, she does not also let him pay for her at the restaurant. She earns enough to do it herself. There will be millions of such examples. And finally what do we have now? Men treat us as if we were men. They forgot what it is to be a gentleman .
The relations between men and women became simply like in the stone age. And when some women who are far from the idea of feminism try to protest men always have a ready answer: "" But you wanted it yourselves "" .
I think that the cause of feminism gave us, women, a lot, but today it has gone too far. There must not be extremes - that is a golden rule. Unfortunately feminists do not understand it , as they do not understand how ridiculous they and their ideas are .
"" We are no worse than men. We want to have everything men have.""
That's a phrase frequently used by them. And gradually they become like men: very rude and not elegant at all .
I don't know about the others, but I want to be a woman, and I want to feel in the presence of men. And I am absolutely sure that most of today's women do not want to have anything in common with today's feminists, who, probably, are establishing the 3rd class now .
So let them fight for their ideas, but don't let's us, women, be taken by them .",B2,"{'title': '392_RUMO4017.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good \n \nFeminism is a phenomenon, which together with television, cinema, numerous flights into the space characterises our crazy 20th century .\nFeminism, what is it actually?

She can do it herself, she does not also let him pay for her at the restaurant. She earns enough to do it herself. There will be millions of such examples. And finally what do we have now? Men treat us as if we were men. They forgot what it is to be a gentleman .\nThe relations between men and women became simply like in the stone age. And when some women who are far from the idea of feminism try to protest men always have a ready answer: "" But you wanted it yourselves "" .\nI think that the cause of feminism gave us, women, a lot, but today it has gone too far. There must not be extremes - that is a golden rule. Unfortunately feminists do not understand it , as they do not understand how ridiculous they and their ideas are .\n"" We are no worse than men. We want to have everything men have.""\nThat\'s a phrase frequently used by them. And gradually they become like men: very rude and not elegant at all .\nI don\'t know about the others, but I want to be a woman, and I want to feel in the presence of men. And I am absolutely sure that most of today\'s women do not want to have anything in common with today\'s feminists, who, probably, are establishing the 3rd class now .\nSo let them fight for their ideas, but don\'t let\'s us, women, be taken by them .\n'}"

"Dedicated to their sports

Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
A Darius (runner)
I've always been sporty. I played a bit of everything at one time, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a trial for a professional football club, but eventually I opted to go down the athletics route instead. My biggest moment came when I got to compete for my country in the youth team and got a medal. It didn't result in much media attention, though, which was a shame. I'd been hoping some sponsorship would come out of it, because the training doesn't come cheap. I train at home all winter and then go away for three weeks, usually Florida, before the season starts. It's good fun - there are great athletics facilities there and the nightlife's great too. You've got to be really disciplined, though. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't, but dedication pays in this sport. The main goal for me is to get to the next Olympics -that would be fantastic.

B Gabriel (surfer)
The surfing community is small, so you get to meet the same guys wherever you compete. Professional surfers are very serious and often the best waves are at dawn, so if you're really going to get anywhere, you have to cut out late-night parties altogether. I don't mind that so much, but I do love having a lie-in, and I usually have to give that up too. But it's worth it,because without that kind of dedication I might not have won the National Championships last year. I make sure that a big night out follows any win, though, and if there's cash involved in the winnings, I'll go away somewhere really nice. And, of course, the sacrifices are worth it in the long run because winning that championship meant I got picked to present a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

C Dieter (yacht racer)
With five lads on a boat together, you have a good laugh. We're very traditional and we always celebrate a win in great style. It's been said that we act a bit childishly when we're out, but we don't actively go looking for media coverage. Sometimes the reporters actually seem more concerned about where you go out celebrating and what you get up to there than about where you came in the race. I'm away for eight months of the year, so it's great to get back, go out with my mates from other walks of life and do the things they do. You can't live, eat and breathe the sport all the time- it's not healthy. I'm known within the world of sailing, but fortunately I can count the number of times I've been recognised in the street on the fingers of one hand. I'd hate to become some sort of celebrity. I get a lot of nice letters from people wanting signed pictures, though. It may take ages, but I reply to every one. It would be cheeky to complain, even if it does take a bit of organising.

D Tomas (tennis player)
It's always a great thing to walk on court and feel that the crowd's behind you. At the last tournament, though, it all got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Despite that, I have to admit that I do still get quite a thrill out of being spotted by fans when I'm out shopping or something. It has its downside though. My last girlfriend didn't like it if I got too much attention from female fans. The thing is,tennis players have to travel quite a lot, and in the end that's why we split up, I guess. That was hard, but you've got to make sacrifices in any sport; you've got to be serious and professional. Actually, it doesn't really bother me too much. I'm content to concentrate on my game now and catch up on the other things in life once I've retired, because, after all, that comes pretty early in this sport.",B2,"{'title': 'aed141b6-5c76-4735-b9ed-f415bfcc2416.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Dedicated to their sports\n\nFour young sports stars talk about their lives.\nA Darius (runner)\nI've always been sporty.

"Title: Death Penalty 
 
Should the death penalty be maintained? For many years, this question has been argued about all over the world. Though recently, opinions about the death penalty in the world are moving toward abolishing it, Japan still continues to execute it. In my opinion, the death penalty should be abolished. The death penalty seems to be the easiest and the permanent solution for the criminal problems, but it is no more than to erase all. Even if it eases the victim's family for a while, it doesn't make any profit. There are some reasons why the death penalty doesn't make sense .
First, the death penalty doesn't have the effect of restraining latest criminals from killing people. People who believe in having the death penalty say that it will make people think twice before committing a crime and that it is useful for the deterrent of a felony. In fact, however, the murder rate has actually gone up instead of down in the past 23 years since execution has become legal. When a murderer commits a crime, he or she must be too excited to think twice or they can't kill people!
Secondly, the death penalty is not necessarily being the hardest punishment for murderers. People who are in favor of the death penalty insist that murderers should be punished by the hardest penalty. In this competitive time, however, many people kill themselves to escape form life's hardships, so death penalty can be, for some murderers, means of escape. Ending the life of the victim also means ending of feeling remorse for his crime. I think murderers must pay for their actions by thinking a great deal of what they did and suffering much remorse, not by being executed .
Thirdly, the death penalty only makes nothing but another sorrow. The life of the victim never be able to be back again even if the hateful murderer is also be killed. It only makes another body die. Let's not forget that the philosophy of ""an eye for an eye."" only makes another blindness after all .
Finally, there is a possibility of courts passing a false sentence. Innocent people have been and will be convicted and condemned to death as long as the death penalty exists. And of course, if never be able to be reversed once it is completed even if it reveals that the conviction is false. The possibility may be so small compared to the number of passing a correct sentence, but there surely is. Can you imagine what it feels like for families of criminals who are condemned to death on a false charge? Even if the possibility is much less than 0.000001%, as long as it exists, the death penalty shouldn't be maintained .
However, there is a problem if the death penalty is abolished. There is a system of parole and life imprisonment in Japan, that means a murderer could be free someday and commit another murder if there was not the death penalty. In that case, the family and friends of the victim won't be relieved forever. Thus, I propose abolishing those two systems as well as the death penalty. This is the conclusion I thought that would be thest, all things considered .",B2,"{'title': '262_JPTF1034.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Death Penalty \n \nShould the death penalty be maintained?

"Title: Mobile Etiquettes Are Urgently Needed

That employees make long phone calls on their mobile phones discussing either their private lives or managing their usual everyday affairs is a well-known fact, unfortunately. These kind of phone calls disturb others while they are trying hard to concentrate on their work. This insufferable situation is due to the fact that no etiquette concerning the adequate and proportionate use of mobile phones has been established at workplaces yet. Therefore, every workplace, company and office should formulate a detailed eituette regarding the use of cellular phones so that employees would not make each other's work performance decline.
Most importantly, by establishing and applying a set of rules restricting the use of mobiles at workplaces the quality of work could be sustained and improved effectively. If there are no redundant mobile calls during work a greater adherence to work and the elimination of phases of milder concentration on the part of employees will both be achieved. This will result in a more successful business management.
In addition to the enhancement of business management, creating a mobile phone etiquette would also lead to ameliorated collegial relationships since everyone would have to take their peers' interests into consideration as well as regards the use of cellulars. Thus, heated debates on the topic would cease because everyone would obey the established rules. As a consequence, cooperation among colleagues would be fostered, and several new friendships may also develop.
It might be argued, however, that such a restricting etiquette is inherently confusing and disorienting since there are quite a few borderline situations at a workplace when it is almost impossible to decide whether responding to a particular call violates the etiquette. Moreover, in such situations one must make a decision within a few seconds, which might not be enough for estimating and anticipating the exact nature of a call, which then also needs to be compared to the points defined in the etiquette. While this is undoubtedly true, it ought to be realised that on the whole the advantages outweigh the mentioned disadvantages; after contemplating all the possible aspects of mobile phone rules, it seems reasonable to claim that in the case of properly defined guidelines employees and employers alike will surely face fewer disturbing or even embarrassing situations related to the improper use of cellular phones than in the case of entirely lacking such rules. The lack of a mobile etiquette would eventually lead to frustrations and a tense atmosphere at any workplace. Hence, mobile phone regulations should be applied at workplaces for the benefit of all the people working there.
In conclusion, it might be stated that a detailed set of rules concerning the use of cellular phones needs to be defined at every workplace since it is the only way to guarantee the high standard and the quality of work. Not only will such rules help to preserve high quality work performance but they will also improve collegial relationships and the atmosphere of the workplace.",B2,"{'title': '204_HUEL4136.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: Mobile Etiquettes Are Urgently Needed\n\nThat employees make long phone calls on their mobile phones discussing either their private lives or managing their usual everyday affairs is a well-known fact, unfortunately.

"She didn't want to come, Steve,' said Carol. 'And now she says that she can see ghosts.' She looked out of the window on to the war memorial in the village square. Everything was silent. Her new husband called it 'a dusty French silence'. Carol called it a dusty hot French silence. It was only April, but it was almost too hot to move.
'I've tried very hard,' Carol continued. 'But she refuses to be my friend.'
'Ghosts?' asked Steve. He was here to rest after a heart attack. Already he was tired of healthy food, no long walks, no heavy drinking and no smoking.
'What sort of ghosts?'
'Oh, I didn't ask,' said Carol. 'Ghosts are ghosts.'
'We'll just have to be patient with her,' replied Steve.
'But it's three years since her mother left you.'
Steve answered her with a sad smile. 'Perhaps Elise isn't happy with you. But that doesn't mean that she's happy with her Mum. Things will get better.'
'You always say that,' said Carol. 'The girl hates me.'
'She's sixteen, Carol,' Steve said, 'She's unhappy. You're new in our lives, and she's not sure about you.'
'When I look at her, she jumps,' said Carol. 'When I come into the room, she leaves it.'

"The United States was becoming a large and powerful country. It stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. The people of the United States believed that one day, all of North America would be part of the United States. This belief was called “Manifest Destiny”. Many people in British North America were afraid they would not be able to defend themselves against such a powerful nation.
In 1865, a Civil War began in the United States between the northern states and the southern states. The North (called the Union) was trying to end slavery in the South (called the Confederacy). Britain was supposed to be neutral in the war. This means it would not help either side. However, certain events caused problems between Britain and the Union government in the northern United States.
The first event was the Trent incident. The South sent two agents to Britain to ask for help in their fight against the North. They traveled on a British ship, the Trent. A Union warship stopped the Trent and found out about the plan. The Union navy took the Southern agents off the Trent. This made the British very angry. The Union had no right to do this in international waters. Britain sent 10,000 soldiers to British North America to prepare for war. The British soldiers found traveling difficult because there was no railway between the Maritime colonies and the Provinces of Canada.

"Gareth Ellis

Gareth Ellis, 13, is the youngest son of Alan, an engineer, and Kath, a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers, but Gareth's dream was always to become a clown. Three years ago, Alan, Kath and Gareth joined the circus. 'People laugh when we tell them,' says Kath. 'But it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three.'
When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to see if they could find full-time circus jobs. They both got jobs with a famous circus and Gareth began training to become a clown.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

The term feminism firs appeared in the 20th century and was associated with groups of women who organized protests and rallies to fight for women's rights. The most famous group was the Suffragette movement which was notorious for being the most radical of them all. This was considered the first wave of feminism by many historians and sociologists. They brought the traditional patriarchal system to its knees and said: ""We will not be treated like cattle, we are human beings like everyone else, and we deserve equal rights."" Although I must agree that first wave feminism created a better world for women and gender relations in general, I believe without a doubt that third wave feminism, or modern day feminism, seeks to damage these relationships that the first wave so desperately sought to create and in a way, unconsciously maybe, tries to destroy it .
On one hand, feminism should provide a safe haven for weak individuals, some modern feminists include men as well, and give them strength and ambition in life. Feminists today are seen as strong excentric individuals, male and female, who fight for equality because they believe that this goal is still not achieved. With the help of social media third wave feminists have gathered many followers all across the world and are supported by many different social justice groups which help them in battling their issues. There are numerous social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube where they share videos in which they spread their messages of equality and justice. There are numerous TV channels that broadcast talk shows where top feminists are invited to talk about social issues. The Internet is the true battlefield for feminists and social justice warriors, who fight against inequality and the horrible patriarchy .
On the other hand, I believe that this movement only consists of groups of attention seekers who are trying to become famous for doing something for the society and gender relations when in fact all they talk about are already resolved issues. Their most frequently used argument is the gender pay gap. They argue that every woman earns 74 cents for every man's dollar, but they fail to reallise that this issue has already been resolved a long time ago and that women actually earn more than a man does. The second argument is the white male privilege argument. They claim that white men are being treated than white women, or women of different colour, by having more rights and being offered better job positions. The thing one, and probably the one most feminists and social justice warriors use in everyday communication is the ""man constantly rape"" argument. This argument creates the biggest problem for gender relations as it is, as mentioned before, forced through the media and social networks by highly respected feminist celebrities worldwide. The problem is that they claim that every form of sexual harassment, be that verbal or physical, or any kind of misconduct towards women should be considered rape and should be legally punished. Unfortunatelly, this lead to cases where women sued men under the claim that the fact they had too much to drink on the night when they had intercourse is sufficient enough of an excuse to prove that they did not give consent. Feminists even agree that this should apply to married couples as well .
In conclusion, it is my honest opinion that third wave feminism creates, or happens to create unconsciously, a world where gender relations are broken, unsafe, unsecure, and without trust which is crucial for healthy relationships by promoting a form of propaganda throug liberal media and social networks .",C2,"{'title': '411_SEBG2014.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good \n\nThe term feminism firs appeared in the 20th century and was associated with groups of women who organized protests and rallies to fight for women\'s rights.

"The Tartan Museum
The modern, cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum contrast sharply with its historic Edinburgh location. But would its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow went to visit the museum just before it opened.
You cannot miss it. At first it was only the outside of the new Museum of Scotland that was unmissable, stuck on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its huge, yellow sandstone tower and cheese-wedge buildings, topped by a hulk of a hanging garden. Last winter the building was greeted with a mix of modernist architectural applause ('masterpiece', 'stunning'), cautious approval ('striking') and outright hostility. This winter, now that the inside is almost ready for the opening, the exhibitions themselves look set for a similar fate.
Forget the does-it-tell-a-nation's-story, is-it-chronological debate. The answers are definitely yes; it is a many-splendoured dream-coat of stories, each hung about a precious historic object, and there is an outline timescale that helps visitors get their bearings but does not strait-jacket the displays. And no, it does not let its lovely national treasures - such as Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the Holyrood chapel silver- get swamped in national pride.
The real issue here. assuming that the collections are properly preserved. is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to come back. Dr David Clarke. the head of exhibitions, insists that a visit should be a pleasurable. visual experience, and that it is designed not for specialists but for those with little prior knowledge. Despite this liberalism. Clarke is a convincing purist when it comes to what is on show. Mock-ups and scenes from the past that rely heavily on imagination are out. For Clarke. they are tantamount to 'giving a complete statement of certainty about what the past was like. which '. he explains, 'would be wrong. The public deserves the truth.' The result is that, at this museum. what you see is what the experts know. But the question for today's visitor is whether the objects' stories can be told vividly enough merely with explanation panels. captions and multi-media interpretation and using barely 30 computers in total around the museum.
Less than three days before the opening, it is still difficult to be sure. Some impressions are clear. though. and it is not just the panoramic views of Edinburgh Castle that take your breath away. Step inside and what immediately hits you is the sequence of spaces. Galleries open one into another. different sizes, different shapes. all with pale walls that are wood- panelled to look like large blocks of stone and inset with deep display cases. Shafts of daylight stream through arrow-slit windows and cascade down from the roof lights. There is room to ponder and enjoy every item on display.
Thanks to the 12-member Junior board. set up three years ago with 9- to l2-year-olds drawn from all over Scotland, the museum also has a Discovery Centre. What the group really wanted was to be able to ride through the displays. Dr Clarke admits. They lost that one, but won a dedicated children's hands-on centre in what should have been the temporary exhibition gallery. As a result. the Twentieth Century gallery, on the top floor. is the only temporary exhibition. Due to change after three years, it is a hotchpotch of objects chosen by Scottish people and other personalities as the items that have had most impact on life in Scotland in the twentieth century. The Prime Minister's suggestion was an electric guitar. Others went for televisions. Thermos flasks and favourite toys. Although the idea is fun. somehow it feels like a lightweight solution that has floated up to the top of the building. not a proper attempt to address serious issues. It may seem less frothy when the computerised bank of personal reasons and recollections goes live next week.
Overall. Dr Clarke seems right when he suggests that 'objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else'.

"Dedicated to their sports

Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
A Darius (runner)
I've always been sporty. I played a bit of everything at one time, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a trial for a professional football club, but eventually I opted to go down the athletics route instead. My biggest moment came when I got to compete for my country in the youth team and got a medal. It didn't result in much media attention, though, which was a shame. I'd been hoping some sponsorship would come out of it, because the training doesn't come cheap. I train at home all winter and then go away for three weeks, usually Florida, before the season starts. It's good fun - there are great athletics facilities there and the nightlife's great too. You've got to be really disciplined, though. If friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn't, but dedication pays in this sport. The main goal for me is to get to the next Olympics -that would be fantastic.

B Gabriel (surfer)
The surfing community is small, so you get to meet the same guys wherever you compete. Professional surfers are very serious and often the best waves are at dawn, so if you're really going to get anywhere, you have to cut out late-night parties altogether. I don't mind that so much, but I do love having a lie-in, and I usually have to give that up too. But it's worth it,because without that kind of dedication I might not have won the National Championships last year. I make sure that a big night out follows any win, though, and if there's cash involved in the winnings, I'll go away somewhere really nice. And, of course, the sacrifices are worth it in the long run because winning that championship meant I got picked to present a surfing series on TV. I guess I'm a bit of a celebrity now.

C Dieter (yacht racer)
With five lads on a boat together, you have a good laugh. We're very traditional and we always celebrate a win in great style. It's been said that we act a bit childishly when we're out, but we don't actively go looking for media coverage. Sometimes the reporters actually seem more concerned about where you go out celebrating and what you get up to there than about where you came in the race. I'm away for eight months of the year, so it's great to get back, go out with my mates from other walks of life and do the things they do. You can't live, eat and breathe the sport all the time- it's not healthy. I'm known within the world of sailing, but fortunately I can count the number of times I've been recognised in the street on the fingers of one hand. I'd hate to become some sort of celebrity. I get a lot of nice letters from people wanting signed pictures, though. It may take ages, but I reply to every one. It would be cheeky to complain, even if it does take a bit of organising.

D Tomas (tennis player)
It's always a great thing to walk on court and feel that the crowd's behind you. At the last tournament, though, it all got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Despite that, I have to admit that I do still get quite a thrill out of being spotted by fans when I'm out shopping or something. It has its downside though. My last girlfriend didn't like it if I got too much attention from female fans. The thing is,tennis players have to travel quite a lot, and in the end that's why we split up, I guess. That was hard, but you've got to make sacrifices in any sport; you've got to be serious and professional. Actually, it doesn't really bother me too much. I'm content to concentrate on my game now and catch up on the other things in life once I've retired, because, after all, that comes pretty early in this sport.",B2,"{'title': '6.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Dedicated to their sports\n\nFour young sports stars talk about their lives.\nA Darius (runner)\nI've always been sporty.

I'm known within the world of sailing, but fortunately I can count the number of times I've been recognised in the street on the fingers of one hand. I'd hate to become some sort of celebrity. I get a lot of nice letters from people wanting signed pictures, though. It may take ages, but I reply to every one. It would be cheeky to complain, even if it does take a bit of organising.\n\nD Tomas (tennis player)\nIt's always a great thing to walk on court and feel that the crowd's behind you. At the last tournament, though, it all got a bit crazy with people crowding around. Despite that, I have to admit that I do still get quite a thrill out of being spotted by fans when I'm out shopping or something. It has its downside though. My last girlfriend didn't like it if I got too much attention from female fans. The thing is,tennis players have to travel quite a lot, and in the end that's why we split up, I guess. That was hard, but you've got to make sacrifices in any sport; you've got to be serious and professional. Actually, it doesn't really bother me too much. I'm content to concentrate on my game now and catch up on the other things in life once I've retired, because, after all, that comes pretty early in this sport.""}"

"Title: In the 19th century, Victor Hugo said: 'How sad it is to think that nature is calling out but humanity refuses to pay heed.' Do you think it is still true nowadays?
 
Victor Hugo's sentence [Quotation] shows that he must have been an early ecologist. In fact, the 19th century was the century of industrialization and was marked by the pursuit of maximal profit. In this pursuit man and nature had no place at all. Probably Victor Hugo clearly perceived this situation .
What Victor Hugo said in the 19th century is still true for the 20th century and even more so. Yet if we had to paraphrase his sentence, we would probably say that [Quotation] . The awareness that man is part of nature goes back to the 1960's, at the time of man's first journeys in space. At that moment astronauts from different missions clearly perceived the earth as being a closed system, like a deserted island lost in the middle of an ocean, and therefore they saw it as a fragile system that needs a strict managment in order to avoid an ecological desaster, in order to save it .
Bit by bit this idea has gained ground. Thus in the 1970's we see the birth of many ecological movements. Little by little the ""calling out of nature"" has reached some ears and man is trying to find an appropriate solution. The more man interferes with nature in a careless way, the more he seeks assurance that somewhere it is beyond his responsibility. Now man's longing expresses itself in catalogues full of ""back-to-nature"" remarks and in the popularity of films like ""Dances with the Wolves"" or ""Le Grand Bleu"". There is a longing to return to a healthier life. Now people dream of what life was like before industrialization .
But now we may wonder whether it is not already too late: the oceans die, rivers and sees are polluted by runoff from industrial plans and by spills from tankers and ships, the atmosphere is getting warmer with the greenhouse effect, certain species of animals are endangered, non-recyclable material waste increase every day and our forests are attacked by acid rain. In short, nature is in danger, we are in danger and the situation requires a quick reaction. Our leaders should come to an agreement in order to set up a special program that would be really efficient. But unfortunatly economical interests come first, they come before mankind's general interest .
It is possible that it is already too late, even if nature absorbs many of our attacks. It is probable that we have gone too far.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. 
 
	Nowadays, more and more people aim towards enrolling at a university and pay a lot of money in the hopes of obtaining a degree. Everyone considers higher education essential for having a successful career. However, the question of whether this higher education actually helps students be prepared for the real world or not remains. It is not as simple to put into practice what one has learned at the university as students believe. The important thing is to learn how to adapt to a new environment. Thus, this essay will look at several concepts, such as the economic aspect of studying at a university, the importance of practice, and the skills that universities should provide the students with .
	Amy Gutmann, a political theorist, stresses the economic aspect of being enrolled in a university. According to her, students who graduate from a university, i.e. those who have a university diploma have higher chances of employment than those who do not. Even though most recent graduates are not convinced by this and consider universities as a waste of time and especially money, the evidence which Gutmann found proves that they are mistaken. The annual income of employed graduates is almost two times higher than that of the employees who have only finished secondary school. Thus, they will regain the money that they have invested in university. Nevertheless, Amy says that she is aware of the fact that ""few people are so economically privileged that they can afford to be motivated solely by the love of learning for its own sake"" [Reference] . Consequently, many students who want to go to higher education cannot do it because of their poor economic situation. Therefore, universities should provide more scholarships, or any kind of financial support, for people that come from families with low income .
	Other important concept is the practice that students should have. University degrees are, in most cases, theoretical, and the theory alone is not enough to prepare students for life after graduating. Larry Alvarado's opinion on what the focus of universities should be, is clearly seen in his statement: [Quotation] [Reference] . 
	The students must feel prepared for life after graduating. That is the reason why universities should strive to provide internships for students, where they can apply their knowledge of theory into practice. The idea is that, while studying, students do not feel disconnected from the real world. In spite of the fact that there is a year or two, provided by the universities, when students can put their learning outcomes into practice, that is not enough for certain professions. Unfortunately, not many universities try to bring about changes in that field. The diplomas continue being theoretical and mainly useless to students once they have graduated . 
	The fact that universities do not prepare students as much as they should is evident in a research that Peter D. Hart conducted on behalf of ""The Association Of American Colleges And Universities"". In this research, recent graduates stress the need for developing certain skills that will be necessary for whatever profession they decide to choose. In every profession, regardless of what university degree students have, the ability to be able to work in teams, to think critically, but also to communicate, both orally and in writing, are skills that are needed and valued the most [Reference] . This phenomenon is also present in the universities in the Republic of Macedonia, where the students have similar thoughts. Being a student, I am familiar with this, and I consider such skills as crucial for further development of each individual in the real world. These skills should serve as a supplement to theoretical knowledge, and being able to apply them will more likely lead to success. However, little attention is paid to these skills in most universities, rather the focus is just on the theory .
	To sum up, despite the importance of theoretical knowledge, it should not be the only aspect on which universities focus their attention. There should be internships provided by the universities, and with them students would be provided with the opportunity to transfer their knowledge of theory into practice. The degree that students get should be relevant, and worth the time and money spent in order to get it. It will have value if universities' central point is not just on information about the specific field of studies of students, but also on certain skills, such as teamwork skills, critical thinking skills, communication skills. If all of these things mentioned above are implemented by universities, the degree will have greater value, not just to students, but also to their future employers .",C2,"{'title': '309_MDCM2024.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world.

However, the question of whether this higher education actually helps students be prepared for the real world or not remains. It is not as simple to put into practice what one has learned at the university as students believe. The important thing is to learn how to adapt to a new environment. Thus, this essay will look at several concepts, such as the economic aspect of studying at a university, the importance of practice, and the skills that universities should provide the students with .\n\tAmy Gutmann, a political theorist, stresses the economic aspect of being enrolled in a university. According to her, students who graduate from a university, i.e. those who have a university diploma have higher chances of employment than those who do not. Even though most recent graduates are not convinced by this and consider universities as a waste of time and especially money, the evidence which Gutmann found proves that they are mistaken. The annual income of employed graduates is almost two times higher than that of the employees who have only finished secondary school. Thus, they will regain the money that they have invested in university. Nevertheless, Amy says that she is aware of the fact that ""few people are so economically privileged that they can afford to be motivated solely by the love of learning for its own sake"" [Reference] . Consequently, many students who want to go to higher education cannot do it because of their poor economic situation. Therefore, universities should provide more scholarships, or any kind of financial support, for people that come from families with low income .\n\tOther important concept is the practice that students should have. University degrees are, in most cases, theoretical, and the theory alone is not enough to prepare students for life after graduating. Larry Alvarado\'s opinion on what the focus of universities should be, is clearly seen in his statement: [Quotation] [Reference] . \n\tThe students must feel prepared for life after graduating. That is the reason why universities should strive to provide internships for students, where they can apply their knowledge of theory into practice. The idea is that, while studying, students do not feel disconnected from the real world. In spite of the fact that there is a year or two, provided by the universities, when students can put their learning outcomes into practice, that is not enough for certain professions. Unfortunately, not many universities try to bring about changes in that field. The diplomas continue being theoretical and mainly useless to students once they have graduated . \n\tThe fact that universities do not prepare students as much as they should is evident in a research that Peter D. Hart conducted on behalf of ""The Association Of American Colleges And Universities"". In this research, recent graduates stress the need for developing certain skills that will be necessary for whatever profession they decide to choose. In every profession, regardless of what university degree students have, the ability to be able to work in teams, to think critically, but also to communicate, both orally and in writing, are skills that are needed and valued the most [Reference] . This phenomenon is also present in the universities in the Republic of Macedonia, where the students have similar thoughts. Being a student, I am familiar with this, and I consider such skills as crucial for further development of each individual in the real world. These skills should serve as a supplement to theoretical knowledge, and being able to apply them will more likely lead to success. However, little attention is paid to these skills in most universities, rather the focus is just on the theory .\n\tTo sum up, despite the importance of theoretical knowledge, it should not be the only aspect on which universities focus their attention. There should be internships provided by the universities, and with them students would be provided with the opportunity to transfer their knowledge of theory into practice. The degree that students get should be relevant, and worth the time and money spent in order to get it. It will have value if universities\' central point is not just on information about the specific field of studies of students, but also on certain skills, such as teamwork skills, critical thinking skills, communication skills. If all of these things mentioned above are implemented by universities, the degree will have greater value, not just to students, but also to their future employers .\n\n\n\n'}"

"Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
When a person commits a crime, he or she should be punished for it. That is at least how most people feel. It seems morally right that the criminal should pay for his actions. Knowing that the criminal will go to prison, secluded from the rest of the world, his freedom and personal life being robbed from him, satisfies society. They get even with him. But does it benefit society in the long run?
Ideally, the criminal would come out of prison as a new and improved person. He will have had time to do some serious thinking about his life and his wrongdoings, and will have been determined to live a better life .
Of course, his is rarely the case. The prison often hardens the criminal, and once the person is free, he will most likely return to living the same lifestyle .
Although the prison has served as a punishment for the criminal, it has also wasted much of the taxpayer's money .
If on the other hand, the criminal goes through some sort of rehabilitation, it would profit both the criminal and the society, given that the criminal is going to be able to live a more productive life once he is free .
Obviously, if the criminal is suffering from a poor mental state, psychiatric help should be given. But at the same time many prisons today teaches the prisoners some type of skill, for instance activities like pottery making, but also different job skills. While it keeps the prisoners occupied when they are locked up, it is also a great help for them when they are released. It should be easier for them to function normally in society, and thus stay away from crime .
In my opinion, a criminal should be punished, as well as being rehabilitated. It is important to set an example to show that society does not tolerate criminal offenses. In addition serving as a punishment for the criminal, prison also keeps them away from society, out of harms way .
While rehabilitation of all criminals would benefit society, it is not realistic. Not every one wants to be helped, and not every one can be helped .
What prison should not be though, but often is today, is a school for the prisoners on how to be a better criminal. This only punishes society .",C1,"{'title': '327_NOAC1008.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: The prison system is outdated.

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent the day in the offices of the magazine Marie Claire.
'Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was tricky because normally I wear a uniform at work. First I went to a still-life photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is such a tranquil, peaceful place - and here I was rushing around when I could be sitting quietly giving an animal a cuddle. Some of the members of the fashion team seemed quite stressed - my job doesn't really get pressurised. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, it made me laugh to think that I'd usually be cleaning out cages or handling rats. I'm fascinated to see how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo so I'll stay put.'
Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent the day at London Zoo.
'I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave thme a green polo shirt instead to work in -which was just as well, as I got very dirty.

When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants - but maybe in Africa.'

Depending on my shifts, I sometimes never see daylight. Even though it was hard work, it was great fun. I thought I was pretty strong but I felt weak compared with the rest of the team. My romantic vision of landscape gardening had not included physical hard work or meticulous planning. I was more an enthusiastic than effective gardener, so I don't plan to give up my other job.'

'I made beds and handed out tablets. I expected to faint when I was doing some jobs, but I amazed myself by finding that it didn't bother me.

"Careless tourists scar ancient alpine rock art 

Tens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed. Scientists and researchers fear that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so [line 6: beginning] rapidly that they will not survive for future generations. [line 6: end]
The mountain, believed to have once been a site for prayer and worship, is scattered with 4,000-year-old drawings cut into bare rock. They include pictures of cows with horns, cultivated fields and various gods and goddesses. But as the popularity of the site increases, the pictures are being ruined by thoughtless graffiti. 
Jean Clottes is the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art. He says, 'People think that because the pictures have been there so long they will always continue to be there. But if the damage continues at this rate there will be nothing left in 50 years.' 
He describes seeing tourists stamping on the drawings, wearing away the rock and definition of the artwork as they do so. Some visitors, he says, even chop off parts to take home as souvenirs. 
'When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture: he said. 'The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and the visitors can't see them properly they simply rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.' 
Other researchers describe how people arrive carrying long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings,or even their names, in the rocks. 
But experts are divided over the best way to preserve the drawings.Henry de Lumley,director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes that the only way to save the site is to turn the whole mountain into a 'no-go' area, preventing the public from going there except on guided tours. Otherwise, he says,not only will the site be completely destroyed but important research work will be reduced. 
Clottes disagrees. 'The measure proposed by Henry de Lumley is the most severe, and while it is the most effective, it is also certain to bring about protests from people who live there,' he said. 'The site was classified as a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do as much as possible to save what is there.'
David Lavergne,the regional architect, also wants to avoid closing the site. 'Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,' he said. 'Our department feels that the best solution is to let people look at the site, but because the area is very big it is difficult to prevent visitors from damaging it. I would prefer that everyone was able to look at it, but the main problem is financial. We do not have the funds to employ the necessary number of guards. We may have to consider charging a fee. There seems to be no prospect of government funding.' 
In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also worked on researching the site, is alarmed that as the mountain becomes easier to reach - tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles - the damage will increase rapidly.She thinks that the only solution is to rope off the area and provide guides.'You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money: she said. 'That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we don't take steps, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation.'",B2,"{'title': '54.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Careless tourists scar ancient alpine rock art \n\nTens of thousands of ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being gradually destroyed.

"Where I get my energy

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life to the full to tell us how they do it. 

A. Jeanette Kupfermann

Journalist and author: 'I think it's excitement. I've got to be doing something that's a challenge. If I'm absorbing something new and learning, I get tremendous energy. Anything to do with rhythm gives me energy, too - at the moment I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is wonderful, very expressive and energising. I think you can feel drained if you're bored, maybe feeling life is pointless. Being effective in the world - even in a small way - gives you energy.' 

B. Linda Kelsey

Magazine editor: 'I have so much work to do but I enjoy it all - I love being at work, it isn't a chore. If you enjoy something, it doesn't make you feel low even though you may be feeling tired. I need a fair bit of sleep so when I do get it I feel really good. When I'm 
running at six hours' sleep a night, I feel a bit wet. I know exercise gives me energy, but it's finding the energy to do it! I do a yoga class once a week before work and I try to do a workout tape at home. But if I've done exercise, my spirits rise amazingly. I get very low patches in the office between 3 and 5 in the afternoon and think it's probably good to eat something then.' 

C. Annie Nightingale

Disc jockey: 'I don't eat healthily to get my energy - I think it's natural enthusiasm and being positive. I really can't stand people with negative attitudes. I'm quite naive - I think we should all enjoy our lives, grab the moment. Enjoyment comes first. You've got to achieve things and set yourself various goals. I enjoy what I do and the last two years have been very exciting. In my line of business there are lots of lively young people and you can't help being affected by that. I love tearing around the place on jobs, having a mad life. I'm very sociable. I enjoy taking photographs but I'm not sure if I'm good at it. I rush to get them processed and can't wait to get them back. 
I've also started writing words for imaginary songs - it's just for fun and it's a good release for my mind when I'm doing a lot of travelling.' 

D. Floella Benjamin

Author and children's TV presenter: 'My energy comes from things I do and enjoy. I believe in what I'm doing, both at work and at home with my family and I think that being positive about life helps. That's why I love working with kids, they give out so much and have an inbuilt resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical, triggered off by communicating with others - just try smiling at people and feel the thrill you get when they smile back. It's far better than feeling sorry for yourself. Although I try to eat healthily and don't smoke or drink, I don't have an exercise plan. The most energetic I get is running around with the kids and playing with them.' 

E. Deborah Moggach

Author and playwright: 'What I love doing more than anything in the world is making a garden out of complete wasteland. I did that once. The garden was solid concrete - I smashed up all the concrete and dug in loads of soil. It was far better than any amount of workouts or tennis. The other thing that gives me energy is knowing that somebody wants to read what I'm writing - I find it difficult to write in a void. And I like sneaking into a farmer's land or a wood. If I'm found, I say ""Oh, what a wonderful wood, I didn't know it was private property,"" and so on. I like it because it's childlike.'

"Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Karl Marx has said that religion was the opium of the masses. I assume that he meant the enormous effect religion has on people; they think that the one they believe in is the only right and are deaf to all other ones. For some people religion is the only thing that matters in this life and nothing else is worth thinking of. Through the ages people have fought and killed for their religion, a fact that again shows how mad and insensitive religion can make us. Not so long ago, I heard a suggestion that if Marx was alive today he would replace religion with television. In some respects this claim seems to be reasonable, but I do have to think twice before maintaining that television has replaced religion in the real life like in this sentence of Marx .
It is true that television has a great role in the life of an average human being; hurrying home after a workday to see The Bold And The Beautiful resembles quite shockingly the necessity of attending a church service regularly. And similarly to the way religion gives people hope of a better life television provides us with the means to escape from this sometimes too depressing world for a while. Formerly families used to read the Bible together, today it might be a wildlife TV-serial that gathers the family up. The Bible tells us what is right or wrong and television advertisements tell us what is the best detergent and how our hair becomes smooth and silky. Both religion and television dull and confuse our mind. Each religion explains things in a one and only possible way, there is no room for any own or other kind of thinking. Television, too, gives us very simple and one-sided views and ready and easy answers and doesn't encourage us to think independently. One more thing that is common to religion and television is the way they both twist our sense of reality. Some sects are appalling examples how religion can lead people to even such an extreme decision as a mass suicide, and I am sure that many youngsters don't realise that a kick in the head can be lethal although the heroes of TV-series never die of one or even get hurt .
Indeed, there seems to be a lot in common between religion and television, and a phrase ""television is the opium of the masses"" sounds, at least to me, pretty accurate. And as it is a fact that nowadays religion is much less important than it used to be, could it, then, be that television has replaced it in the real life, too? No, I do not think so. Although both television and religion offer people a way to escape from the ""worldly"" pressures, resorting to religion is a much more conscious and acceptable choice than getting addicted to some stupid TV-series or drugs. I cannot think of anyone being proud of his/her devotion to the telly, but, as we all know, some religious fanatics are ready to kill or get killed for their faith. This is probably because of the notion most of us fortunately still have that there is always other human beings behind every television program, not some supernatural forces that could be compared to any religious, or ideological, power .",C2,"{'title': '107_FIHE1001.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses.

"Title: The prison system is outdated. No civilized society should punish its criminals: it should rehabilitate them 
 
There are almost 2 million Americans in prisons in the U.S. today. Many of these criminals go in and out of jail their whole life. Prisons are the perfect school for criminals. They can go in with a ""Bachelor"" degree in stealing cars, and then a few years later they can come out with a ""Masters"" degree in narcotic smuggling. The criminals often share information ""in the joint"" about what they know best, usually criminal stuff .
What can this world give the criminals in prison after they have served their time? It is hard to imagine how it must be. Serving years behind bars and then trying to blend in to our society. First of all, things change and the life they knew isn't the same any more after all those years. They have to adapt to ""our new"" world. This must be very difficult for them. Getting a job is important, but who wants an ex-criminal with a criminal record to work for them? If they fail getting a job, they often do what they know they do best, criminal stuff .
The prisons system should help the prisoners to get a new start in life. Help them with a college degree, or train them to be able to get some kind of a descent job after they are done serving there time. Let them work and feel that they are a part of something important and are needed in society. But most of all show them there is more to life than being a criminal. It is possible to make descent money doing ""normal"" stuff .
The most important issue to help prisoners with, that will later live in our community, is to help them understand that they cannot keep on disobeying the law. Everybody should be able to talk to a psychiatrist, or some person that will help him or her in his or her situation they now have to serve time in jail for .
Putting the prisoners ""away"" in jail cells will usually not help the prisoners, especially later on in life. After being stuck in a cell for many years, like an animal in a cage, away from any kind of freedom, the prisoners will probably have more problems when they get out, than when they where put in .
The jail system needs to be changed. For thousands of years we've locked criminals up in prisons. There have to be other solutions .
There is a reason why criminals get caught for something illegal again and again and are put back in jail. But why anyone would dare disobeying the law ever again after serving time in prison, is outrageous, but happens too often and shows that serving time in prison does not help nor change the prisoners lifestyle .
A descent job would definitely be a huge lift for them in changing their lifestyle. That is why they need help in prison, talk to psychiatrists or people who can help them and working so they can feel good about themselves and not wanting to go back to there old lifestyle as criminals .
All of these issues are depending on one thing. Money. The taxpayers are the ones who will suffer for all the ""help"" the criminals in prison will need.

"The long-distance runner

Richard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-metre runners, visits the Kenyans’ high-altitude training camp.

Ten miles south of the equator, a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi. The track marks the start of the trek up Kenya's highest peak, the glacier-capped Mount Kenya. This gorgeous, if lonely and isolated, spot is Nanyuk: for the past three years it has been my base for mid-winter altitude training in Kenya's Central Highlands.
But not once on those trips had I trained with Kenyan runners on their home soil. On my fourth and most recent winter training trip to Kenya, however, I broke a personal tradition. I both competed in my first-ever race in Kenya’s oxygen-thin air and stayed at Kenya’s national team training camp, which is where the country’s top runners prepare for their annual assault on the World Cross-Country Team Championships.
I was invited by Kenya's national team coach when I finished fifth - behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan - in the World Championship 1O,000 meters race. It was an opponunity not to be missed. Training at high altitude produces more red blood cells, which improves oxygen-carrying capacity.
These benefits have been borne out by the successes of generations of Kenyan runners.
My first African race - which came before my spell at the Kenyan team training camp - was also a first for the whole continent. Held in Nairobi, it was the first-ever international cross-country race to be held on African soil.
If nothing else, it was a humbling experience. Of the 41 runners who finished ahead of me, all but 3 were Kenyan. And I honestly felt I hadn't had a bad race!
However, I don’t believe Kenyan success can entirely be put down to the altitude factor. Kenyan runners are also noted for their refreshingly uncomplicated approach to the sport. While their running style is seemingly effortless, their diet simple and their manner of conversation relaxed, they also seem to love competing.
But the least discussed aspect of the puzzle of Kenyan success was perhaps the most basic: how do they train? My stay with the Kenyan runners at their team training camp soon provided the answers.
The national team training camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya, surrounded by beautiful playing fields and dense tropical vegetation.
It's a fairly basic affair, though: there are few comforts. The athletes live among the college's regular students and are housed six to a room in cinder-block dormitories.
The athletes' days at the camp are dominated by three work-outs: a leisurely early-morning run, interval training at mid-morning, followed by a steady run in the late afternoon. The daily regime began at six. We crawled from our bunks and assembled to be briefed by the coaches for the morning run.
“Run easy, you have a hard job today”, we were warned as we left by the coach who'd invited me.
The total distance covered each day was about 40 kilometres - a little short of a marathon distance. The only exception was Sunday, with just the one scheduled run of 20 kilometres, which certainly came as a welcome respite from the rest of the week’s three daily work-outs.
Running apart, life was complication-free. A splash of water on the face and a brush of the teeth sufficed for pre-breakfast preparations. Breakfast itself consisted of tea, bread and boiled eggs, taken in a sparsely-lit, small dining area.
Lunch and dinner both had a similar menu: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach and tea. When the day's running was over, in the early evening, we would pile into a car and drive down to bathe properly in one of the many streams that run off from Mt Kenya’s shrinking glaciers.
By the time I left the camp, I was even more appreciative of Kenyan success. That success just can’t be attributed to genetics or upbringing or altitude alone.
I couldn't stop myself pondering upon a rather different explanation: that the purity and simplicity of the mountainside lifestyle, these gruelling work-outs and this passion for success, perhaps these are the secrets, perhaps these are the real reasons behind Kenya’s rise to the top of world distance running.",C1,"{'title': '466c7d04-9252-4476-8ed8-da21f61b3aa9.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""The long-distance runner\n\nRichard Nerurkar, one of Britain's top 10,000-metre runners, visits the Kenyans’ high-altitude training camp.\n\nTen miles south of the equator, a sony mountain track leads off the quiet metalled road from Nairobi.

"Interview Tips

First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words.
Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, 'I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated I was very confident.' She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher.'I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,' she recalls. 'I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time.' Mary didn't get the job. In fact, one of her friends who also teaches at the school told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, 'If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?' 
As Simon Grant, hotel manager, says: 'Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's what's inside that counts, but in an interview you should aim to come across in the best possible way.'
Yet many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but wasn't even given an interview. 'I thought it was a mistake so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,' she says. 'He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.' 
Movement and gestures will also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message. So make sure your words agree with your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer. 
It is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. 'I was delighted,' she recalls. 'But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.' 
Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to inform yourself about the company before you go for an interview. 'The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company.' 
Businessconsultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, 'Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points.'",B2,"{'title': '10d0e5bf-2406-4287-aea8-7a1cda01016c.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Interview Tips\n\nFirst impressions are often lasting ones.

"Little Chefs

"The man of whom I am now going to tell you was famous, not for his
wealth or his power or his deeds in war, but for his great gentleness.
He lived more than seven hundred years ago in a quaint little town of
Italy. His name was Francis, and because of his goodness, all men now
call him Saint Francis.

Very kind and loving was Saint Francis - kind and loving not only to men
but to all living things. He spoke of the birds as his little brothers
of the air, and he could never bear to see them harmed.

At Christmas time he scattered crumbs of bread under the trees, so
that the tiny creatures could feast and be happy.

Once when a boy gave him a pair of doves which he had snared, Saint
Francis had a nest made for them, and the mother bird laid her eggs
in it.

By and by, the eggs hatched, and a nestful of young doves grew up.
They were so tame that they sat on the shoulders of Saint Francis and
ate from his hand.

And many other stories are told of this man's great love and pity for
the timid creatures which lived in the fields and woods.

One day as he was walking among the trees the birds saw him and flew
down to greet him. They sang their sweetest songs to show how much
they loved him. Then, when they saw that he was about to speak, they
nestled softly in the grass and listened.",B1,"{'title': 'text_136.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""The man of whom I am now going to tell you was famous, not for his\nwealth or his power or his deeds in war, but for his great gentleness.\nHe lived more than seven hundred years ago in a quaint little town of\nItaly.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 
 
These days, education plays an important role in each society. Everybody attempts to be educated. They enter university to improve their knowledge on a specific subject in order to be an expert and this issue is more important for young members of society. However, there are some debates on the purpose of education. Mostly believe that the purpose of education is preparing the students for their future job, while some argue that most of the university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. In my opinion, obtaining a university degree does not necessarily mean that one is ready to start working. There are some reasons that I am going to discuss in the following paragraphs .
The first reason is that the statics show that most of the people who are graduated from university do not have a job that is related to the subject matter that they have studied at university. We can also see some people who have M.A or B.A in some field of study; however, they are working in a place that is totally different from the degrees they hold. For example, best scenario considered in Iran a person who wants to be an English teacher, before getting a B.A and studying in a university for that purpose, can be a good English teacher. Another example is that, there are a lot of great English teachers that they studied engineering in university or any other subject matters but have proved to be great teachers. Another one applies to the situation where holding a B.A or M.A, regardless of what the subject matter is, will give one the opportunity to be accepted in some important jobs like being a banker, or working in a governmental company. It means that the subject matters that are being taught in universities are not related to the job opportunities that exist in the society. Therefore, it shows the impracticality of the university degrees regarding the fact that they do not prepare students for real life situations .
The Second reason is that the theoretical credits that students have in university are a way more than the practical credits that they have. In most of the prestigious Iranian universities, most of the credits are theoretical, and when it comes to the practical credits there are always some problems like not having enough equipment, enough time and having over crowded classes that the professor decides to skip them and do not waste the time in order to work more on the theoretical credits. As result of this, there are some training courses that before having a job, one has to attend them. These training courses are totally educational without any payment and one has to enroll in order to get the job. For example, even if someone has a B.A in teaching English, that person has to pass some teacher training courses in order to start working in an institute. On the other hand, a person who has studied an irrelevant major to teaching English, only by passing these training courses is competent enough to teach in any institute. Some people argue that people who have passed those courses at university and then pass these training courses will be more knowledgeable and successful. However, the truth is that they will be more knowledgeable but not necessarily more successful in real life and their job. The point is that the credits that students pass during their education program at university are more theoretical than being practical and do not prepare students for the real life .
Consequently, as I mentioned above, most of the university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. Universities need to focus in some areas to prepare the students for the real life. First, they should improve the classrooms to the latest technology and keep up with the new technology and innovations. Second, professors must be qualified and proficient in the subjects or skills they are about to teach. A professor who knows nothing about the subject matter cannot prepare students for the real life. Third, curriculum must keep up with newest and latest knowledge and it has to constantly change depending on what is relevant in the workplace. In other words, it must include all the knowledge, skills and training that is necessary for a person who wants to start working after graduation. And they should always consider that Students must be required to show mastery of the skills that they have studied before graduating. It is not enough that they graduate. They must be highly-skilled graduates. The ultimate goal must be for students to be prepared for a life beyond their classrooms .",B2,"{'title': '226_IRMA14013.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of little value. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? \n \nThese days, education plays an important role in each society. Everybody attempts to be educated. They enter university to improve their knowledge on a specific subject in order to be an expert and this issue is more important for young members of society. However, there are some debates on the purpose of education. Mostly believe that the purpose of education is preparing the students for their future job, while some argue that most of the university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world.

"Behind the dolphin's smile

People love dolphins. We rush to look at them in seaside marinas, films and TV programmes. Yet according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society their plight is desperate. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of the species. 

Dolphins hold a special place in our affections. They are among the most intelligent animals we know, they are sensitive to human emotions, and they allow us to dream of wonderful freedom out in the wild seas. 
This love affair has been encouraged by TV. First there was Flipper, and now there's Darwin, the star of Seaquest. However, these happy portrayals hide the reality of life for dolphins in the polluted and overfished seas of the 
late twentieth century.
The population of North Sea harbour porpoises (one kind of dolphin) is estimated to have been reduced by up to 89,000. You may expect such popular animals to be protected by law and taken care of in special marine reserves. This is not the case, however, and the lack of plans to look after them may become one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our times. 
Forty different kinds of dolphins are recognised worldwide. In the waters of northern Europe, the greatest number of dolphins are the striped, the common, the bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The first two generally live far out in the open sea. They are normally seen only in small groups, flashing quickly past ships, and we know very little about them. 
The large grey bottlenoses and harbour porpoises, on the other hand, were once a common sight near to European coasts. Bottlenoses are particularly social and used to be found on the Channel coast and in river mouths in Britain, including the Thames. Resident populations can nowadays be found only in the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales, and the skin injuries found on the few that still remain indicate that they are suffering from stress. 
The complicated habits of the dolphins make it difficult to decide on the exact reasons for this reduction in numbers. The overfishing which is dramatically reducing the world's fish stocks and which is threatening to destroy local fishing industries, also threatens porpoises and dolphins. This is because porpoises have to find their food within a limited time. If fish in one area are removed by fishing, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. 
They are also in danger of getting caught in fishermen's nets which are thought to be invisible to them. In many modern fishing methods, huge nets are left to float or are pulled at great speed through the sea. In recent years, hundreds of dead dolphins have been washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks, ropes and cuts on their bodies show that the main cause of death was the fact that they had been caught by such nets. 
Waste and other substances found in the sea can be stored in the bodies of dolphins. One example is what happens with pesticides: these poisons are soluble in fat, which means that the dolphins can digest them and they can build up in their bodies. The females then produce milk that is rich in pesticides, thus passing the poison in a concentrated fashion on to their young. There is already one recorded case of a young dolphin being poisoned and killed by its mother's milk. 
But perhaps the most controversial threat to dolphins is the one posed by human disturbance. Dolphins live in groups and receive information about much of their world through sound. In the sea, noise pollution - from ships, oil wells and so on - is transmitted four times more efficiently than in the air. This may disturb the dolphins in ways that we do not yet 
understand.",B2,"{'title': '43.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Behind the dolphin's smile\n\nPeople love dolphins.

"Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
Human life is valuable and unique to everyone. Now one can decide when a person dies. Murder is a kind of most serious crime ' commonly ' around us. Everyone should be protected by the law and those murder should receive their appropriate punishment. However, should we send the murders to death in all kinds of murder cases? Life is valuable, so is there any contradiction to what we said above?
Capital punishment is not really applied to many countries which is bounded by law. It is a punishment that sends the criminals by hanging, injecting poisonous materials into the body or by using electricity. No matter what way is used, it is also horrible to the criminal. Therefore, before we decide if we should carry out the capital punishment, we should know clearly about what are the reasons to do so. Also, are there any other alternatives to replace it?
Undoubtedly, the death penalty is really threatened to the public. It is a good signal to threaten people not to the serious crimes. However most cases of murder may not be a ' well planned ' crimes. The murder may commit the crime unconsciously. Most of the murders may kill a person when they were in a condition of uncontrolling. It could not be denied that the criminals really felt guilty because of their unconscious decision. Moreover, murder is a case that difficult to be investigated. It may not be rared to find a case that was really determinated wrongly. Therefore if we sent the criminal to death, we might do something wrong and which is no return! Although there might be some ways for the criminals to appeal, it's still difficult to convict the judge to believe since in fact the case was determinated before. Besides, those cases with really evidence to prove the criminal is not guilty .
People may argue that since the murders killed people. It is fair to punish them by the capital punishment. However, is ' life replaces life ' is meaningful? In fact, sending the criminals to life sentience has been destrive their life freedom. They have no right to do what they want, besides receive orders in the prison. Actually, if the murders were punished for their who life time in the prison, the public has been protected. There are some restrictions to apply to the life penality if the capital punishment is abandoned. The reason for this is to gurentee the safety of the public .
In short, I think all people's life are valuable and important. The people being killed are pity and depressing to their families. However, killing the murder is just the same cases of ' murder'.

"SAMUEL PEPYS 

The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It gives a detailed and interesting description of everyday life in England between 1660 and 1669. Pepys writes about important news stories of the time, like disease, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames and the Great Fire of London. 
He also writes about himself, even about his faults - he often slept during church or looked at the pretty girls. He describes his home life - a quarrel with his wife and how they became friends again, his worry about her illness.

"Living in the valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival.
It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter, even before November was out. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills.
Soon snow began to fall. Within a day it lay some 15 centimetres deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. Up there the wind blasted fiercely. Deep in our valley we felt only sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed but the branches held firm.
And yet we knew that there was reason for us to worry. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed so gently, that threatened us most. It reminded us of what could have occurred if circumstances had been different, if the flow of water from the hills had not, many years before, been controlled, held back by a series of dams.
In a short time the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched furious clouds pile up high over the hills to the west. Sinister grey clouds extended over the valleys. They twisted and turned, rising eastwards and upwards, warning of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which every day was becoming fuller and wilder.
The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds, but high up in the hills the reservoir was filling and was fast approaching danger level. And then it happened - for the first time in years the reservoir overflowed. There in the heights it was like the Niagara Falls, as the water surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. 
The river seemed maddened as the waters poured almost horizontally down to its lower stretches. Just a couple of metres from our cottage, the stream seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was far deeper than we'd ever seen it so near our home, lunging furiously at its banks. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside.
On many occasions through the centuries before the dam was built, the river had flooded the nearby villages in just such a rage. Now, though, the dam restricts the flow of the river and usually all is well; the great mass of water from the hills, the product of snow and torrential rain, remains behind its barrier with just the occasional overflow. We can thus enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley, and can be thrilled by the tremendous power which we know the river possesses. Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.",B2,"{'title': '16.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Living in the valley\n\nWe had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival.\nIt was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter, even before November was out.

	Everyone of us, when we are young, we dream of how our life will be when we get to be when we are grow adults and what proffession we will have.

The dreamers and the ones who imagine and want to see the world become a better place, are mocked upon.
	Some time ago, most of the people believed strongly in God, acted as he willed and tried to improve themselves to be better human being. They believed in the abnormal and the metaphysics. They maybe were naive to believe this things and ""Had a strong imagination"" but at least they were not as thick-skinned as we have become. Science has taken that away from us. These days most young people are atheists since they believe that either they have evolved from the apes (Darwin) or have evolved from cells and chromosomes...

	When we were young we played outdoors in the neighboorhood with the neighboors kids and our friends from school, always getting ourselves wet and dirty, until all of our mothers came outside and yelled for us to go inside.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
In the time past women were oppressed by men in many ways than one. They could not be independent or even express themselves because everything or situations back then did not allow them. But now since we are living in a global world things are changing. Men did not allow women to be who they wished to be because it was [?t a worm?] that a woman's place is in the kitchen. So men generally were there main culprits as far as feminism is concerned. Even in places like a church, women were nor allowed to occypy leadership positions by men .
Today things have changed dramatically after the democratic changes in South Africa even in the World. But in Some Countries feminism is also a problem. In Communists or totaliterian countries women are still oppressed, in a way their talents are wasted. These led to women to unite against their governments .
In South Africa, during the apartheid regime women were oppressed by the government even in their communities. Bur they played a [?pivotent?] role in gaining their freedom and for their rights to be recognised. Culturally and traditionally women were oppressed by their husbands and the chiefs. It was a widespread problem for them. But they continued to fight for their independence and for to be treated as equals in the society .
After democratic elections in South Africa things changed. Women fought for their rights. In democratic countries or civilised societies women are treated as equals. Their independence helped them not to be treated as an inferior beings to men .
Unfortionately these independent women are misintepretting equality and independence as freedom. Some women feminist are out to prove a point that they can do things on their own. They don't care who gets hurt along the way. This is causing problems in the society or in many homes. Many families are broken or destroyed because women (feminists) cannot obey their husbands or atleast be mothers in their homes. They still want to exercise their new pound power over their husbands or families. So this is doing more harm than good to them because nobody wants to be with them let alone marrying them .
In Civilised societies, feminism is practiced by both men and women. We are now doing in an upnormal society because of these [/anisisfeprefations?] . Some women feminists are going for revenge against men or those who took away their independence for so long. Some spend the rest of their lives unmarried because nobody wants to be with them. Men choose to be with the less educated, rural women than with those who have many degrees / or more educated. They are bringing hot coals over themselves because of their egos. Education or [?Oudating?] big companies by these women is causing problems for them. They are materialist .
The heartbreaking issue is that of their kids. They grow up without father figures to look up to. They want to have control over everything. They are unable to distinguise their role as women in their homes as in the society. This is a problem not only for them but also for those who are close to them .
I believe women should be given a free role in the governance of the country and in their homes. But they should always remember that they are women. They need men to make things [?wornel?] for all concerned. Oppression over women is not good at all. Women's rights should not be violated.

"WORKING FOR AN AIRLINE

Nicola Peet left school at eighteen, went to college and then worked at a local airport. After nine months, she went to work for Saudi Arabian Airlines and then she joined British Airways as an air hostess. Four years later, she got her present job as a manager.
This is what she told us about her job:
'My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time in the air. I teach air hostesses and help them with any problems. I also go to lots of meetings.
My hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check plane times on my computer and then I speak with some of the air hostesses.
Sometimes I go on long flights to check how the air hostesses are doing. That's my favourite part of the job, but I like office work, too. Travelling can be hard work. When I get back from a long journey, all I can do is eat something and then go to bed! I don't earn much money, but I'm happy with British Airways and want to stay there and continue to travel.'",A2,"{'title': '22.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'A2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""WORKING FOR AN AIRLINE\n\nNicola Peet left school at eighteen, went to college and then worked at a local airport.

"The weeks passed and the corn grew high. Skip tried to think of ways to annoy Frosby, to force him to rent part of the river to him.
But he forgot about Frosby when Maggie came home for the summer holidays.
Skip met her at the airport in New York, and they drove up to Maine. Skip thought she looked taller; she was certainly more beautiful!
'I've got a surprise for you at home,' Skip said.
'Oh - a horse, perhaps?'
Skip had forgotten she was learning to ride. 'No, not a horse.' The surprise was a red Toyota. He had remembered, at least, that Maggie's school had taught her to drive. She was very excited, and threw her arms round Skips neck. 'Oh, Father, you're so sweet! And you're looking very well!'
Skip and Maggie went for a drive in the new car the next morning. In the afternoon Maggie asked her father if she could go fishing in the stream. He had to tell her that she couldn't, and he explained the reason.
'Well, never mind, there are a lot of other things to do.' Maggie enjoyed going for walks, reading and doing little jobs in the house.
Skip was surprised one evening when Maggie arrived home in her Toyota carrying three fish. He was afraid she had been fishing in the stream, against his instructions.

Some people have complained about this year's collection, New Writing 3, although I cannot understand why. Surely 500 pages of original writing of this quality, for PS6.99, is pretty amazing?
Fiction - both parts of novels and complete short stories - makes up most of the book. There are some enjoyable pieces by famous writers, such as Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. It's a strange fact that the less well-known people seem to have written mainly about food. Take my advice about Jane Harris' s Those Nails - this piece should definitely not be read just after meals. It contains some very unpleasant scenes which could turn your stomach!
There is fine work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are pieces from novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Finally, there is a little non-fiction, which includes a very funny article by Alan Rusbridger on certain newspapers, and an extraordinary piece about herself from Ursula Owen.

"Title: In the words of the old song ""Money is the root of all evil"". Agree or disagree? 

Money is the most ridiculous thing that has ever been invented since the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Money is one of two main reasons why we are going through such struggle these days. The second reason is people's enormous thirst for power. However, these two are closely related. I went to the secondary school of economics and I still remember when we learned how money was invented in Italy somewhere around 13th century, I believe. What I remember best is that the invention of money imediately triggered some conflicts among people. It does not matter which form money takes, the consequences are the same. However, people often have to accept things as they are. In other words, we have to get up at 6 AM each morning, work all day long until a woman from a political party calls us and asks us to vote and to join one of those political satanistic organizations. If there were no money, there would be no politics and our life would be perfect. If people weren't greedy and shared food and properties, there wouldn't be a need for something like the money is. Money is just a physical form of human greed, which is one of seven deadly sins. Every time I try to read news, I end up with reading either about some wars somewhere in the world or about amazingly bad political situation in my country. Everything is the consequence of human greed, gluttony, lust, and many more ""virtues"" that will lead this world to an end. Therefore, if someone asked me how to try to define money, I would say that it was a piece of Satan's hand. Every single war after WW2 started by offering enormous sums of money to some people that were ""chosen"" to do their job. But I must admit that it works perfectly. Now they legalize weed only to earn some profit, even on their own kids. It has gone too far, in my opinion. I should be politically correct and say that the money can be good, too. No, it is awesome, because you can buy sausages, gallows, or even duckling. It is true, but they are using it to buy armor and guns, to build their new airplanes and to support the world's progressive degradation and destruction. It doesn't matter who is who - all people are the same - they tend to destroy everything. The most evil consequence of the use of money is the change in personality of a certain person. Money changes people and they are never again the same. What they want is always more, and more, and more. This leads us to conclusion that those people are not so happy as it may seem. It is very interesting that many rich and successful artists died of some very expensive drugs and later it was discovered that they were depressive for some reason. That reason can easily be the money. The more you have - the more you want. People forget why they wake up and they lost their purpose in life beside that much euros and dollars. However, I still believe that things can change. The money was not dirty and bloody until people made it be like that. The only reason why I like money is the word money, because if money had not been invented, Pink Floyd wouldn't have been able to make one of their best guitar solos of all time besides ""Comfortably Numb"".

In many cases they are fired after six months and have to start all over again .
This of course is a very annoying situation, but what, to me, is even more annoying, is the fact that ""experience"" is always required .
Just fold the newspaper open and take a look at job advertisements; you will rarely find an add where a person with no experience qualifies the prospect .
My question then is, ""how can a just graduated, fresh ex-student, have experience""?
Let us look at the translators/interpreting section for example. It seems that most colleges or universities for translators and interpreters are not familiar with the situation of apprenticeships, contrary to the hotelmanagement section, where students can go abroad for four months and work in hotels .
Future social workers and nurses also have to work in their branch for a certain period and are evaluated then .
Would it not be better for all colleges and universities to introduce these apprenticeships, so that students are already aware of what they are getting into, instead of just throwing them to the wolves when they graduate?
Now we have come to the issue of doing exams in order to pas. For some courses the situation of permanent evaluation already exists, but for most subjects you still have to take an exam .
Is this a fair system?
In my opinion it is not, because you are evaluated on two or three questions taken from a book of maybe threehundred pages. If you are lucky you can answer these questions. If not, too bad, then you are nicely invited to take your exam again in September, even though you knew the rest of your book perfectly well .
In my opinion apprenticeships and permanent evaluation are the perfect solution; you are judged by experts in the field, who can keep an eye on you all day, whereas at college or university a professor has to spread his or her time over 20 students or more .
The conclusion we can only make is that universities and colleges really have to take action to reform these situations, not today but yesterday .",B1,"{'title': '081_DBAN1016.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world.

"REMOVAL DAY

With her children now grown, widowed Susan faces leaving the family home.

The van said, Susan noticed, 'Removers of Distinction', and indeed, every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man, his enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables, and his team of helpers, not so gentle.
It was a lovely house that she was leaving, an elegant four-storeyed building overlooking a tiny harbour. The years she had spent there, the years of the children growing up and leaving, hung around in the air, faintly present like agitated dust. 
When told that they had bought this house, Robert, then five, had asked thoughtfully, 'Mum, when you buy a house, how d'you get it home?' You could miss a little boy in the physical presence of the adult he had become; Robert was here, helping, and in particular making sure she didn't let on about the piano. Francesca was here too, also helping, in her bossy way, stubbornly certain that nobody but she, the family daughter, would be careful enough over a fine instrument like a Steinway piano.
'She doesn't look like she's going to cry on us,' observed Fred. 'That's something.' 'Do people cry?' Susan asked, intrigued. 'You'd be surprised,' said Fred. 'They go around merry as magpies helping out till its all in the van, then you look round and there they are, crying in the middle of an empty room. They're fine when we get to the new place, mind. It's just seeing everything taken apart that upsets them.'
She could easily imagine.
Left to herself, Susan would have warned the removers about the piano before accepting the estimate. Robert had said sternly that it was their business to see the problem, and their bad luck if they didn't. The piano now stood in solitary glory in the upstairs sitting room, the best room in the house. They would leave it till last, naturally. Sitting on the bottom stair, for all the chairs were gone now, she remembered the time they had arrived.
The day she was living through now was like that day filmed and run backwards - the piano had been carried in first. And it had got stuck on the stairs. For nearly two hours the team of removal men struggled manfully with it, until it seemed they would simply have to give up.
They brought it up to the turn of the stairs, and down again, and cut out banister rails, and got it jammed anyway, while little Robert looked on enthralled, and young Francesca wailed, 'We can't live in a house without a piano! We can't! I'd rather die!' And of course they couldn't, not with a musical daughter destined to be a concert pianist. They had to find a way to get it in, and a way had been found.
Peter, her late husband, had come home to the crisis and had resolved it. The piano had been left in the garden while the other furniture was brought in - there was much less of it then, they had been relatively young and hard up. And next day, to everyone's surprise, a builder had been engaged to take out the first floor window.
Then, from the quay below the house, where fish were unloaded from the inshore boats, a little crane was borrowed, and dragged up the hill by means of the local farmer's tractor. Finally, the piano was wrapped in blankets, hooked to the crane and gently swung safely through the gaping window, while the entranced children danced with joy at the sight of it.
However, the whole process had cost so much it was months before they could afford to have the piano professionally tuned. 'That's that,' Peter had said. 'That's there for ever.' But for ever is a long time.
The children were increasingly too busy to come home at weekends, and Susan was no longer so mobile in the house, and puffing as she climbed the stairs. The thought of the stairs interrupted her daydream. The banister rails were still not quite parallel, they had not been put back perfectly all that time ago. She ought to have warned the removers, surely she ought. But now it was too late. Any moment now they would find it. She looked around, dazed and panic-stricken.
'Are you all right, love?' Fred was saying. 'Mind yourself, it's just the piano to come now, and then we'll be on our way.' She moved from the bottom stair, heart beating. Robert and Francesca had both appeared, standing in the back of the hallway to watch. 'No tears then?' Fred said, conversationally.
Truth to tell she was just on the edge of them. How odd that simply moving things made them matter. Chairs and cups and things, hundreds of things, that one never noticed or gave a moment's thought to while they stayed put, now they were displaced, were full of pathos, crying out to be cared about - and she would have cried, in a moment, surely she would.
Only just then the piano appeared, lurching at the top of the stairs, with Fred backing down in front of it and one of the others behind. It tipped slightly. 'Easy does it!' cried Fred, and they carried smoothly down the stairs and out of the front door, and put it down behind the removal van on the road.
It was Robert who laughed first, but then they couldn't stop laughing, relieved that it was all over. All three of them, helplessly, leaning against each other, gasping for breath and laughing more. 'What's the joke, then?' asked Fred, but he merely started them off again. So that, as they went, the three of them, arm in arm down the path for the last time, the only tears she shed were tears of laughter.",C2,"{'title': '51.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""REMOVAL DAY\n\nWith her children now grown, widowed Susan faces leaving the family home.\n\nThe van said, Susan noticed, 'Removers of Distinction', and indeed, every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed.

"The Cabinet-Maker
Charles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him
Charles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry. I arrive at his workshop, tucked under a railway arch in East London, and am greeted with a quick handshake and the words: 'Well, fire away then!' Whether this brusqueness is real or a front hiding a shy streak is not immediately apparent. But a glance around the workshop reveals that Hurst is obviously busy, with good reason not to waste a minute of his time.
The arched space is full of half-made pieces of furniture and planks of wood in an amazing array of natural colours. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built up a very nice reputation for himself. His order book is always full for several months in advance, despite the fact that he does not really promote himself. Word has spread that if you want a decent cupboard or table, bookcase or kitchen units, Hurst is your man.
Of course, finding a furniture-maker is not that taxing a task. Wherever you live in the countryside, the craft is alive and well. But finding a cabinet- maker who prides himself on making beautifully crafted furniture with clean, simple lines is less easy. 'There are few real cabinet-makers now. People call themselves furniture-makers,' Hurst says wearily. As a craftsman who sets himself exacting standards, he is continually disappointed by some contemporary furniture. 'I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will put up with.' He rails against shoddy, mass-produced furniture, and craftsmen who churn out second-rate pieces.
Such a quest for perfection is obviously a key to Hurst's success. That and his talent. This man is not coy about his ability. Indeed, his blatant self- confidence is as surprising as his initial brusque manner. 'I have a huge natural ability,' he says, with a deadpan expression. 'I have always been good at making things.' If it were not for the self-deprecating mood into which he slipped towards the end of our interview, I would have believed his conceit to be wholly genuine.
Hurst is self-taught. So how did he learn his craft? 'I asked the right questions and picked it all up,' he says nonchalantly. Almost all of his commissions come from private individuals ('l used to do some commercial work for companies but it was soul-destroying'). Some clients have returned time and again. 'You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying.' But he is honest enough to admit that relationships with clients do not always run smoothly. 'The most infuriating clients are those who don't know what they want, and then decide they do when it's too late ... my favourite clients are the exacting ones.'
If Hurst has every reason to be pleased with himself, he is also gracious in his praise for others - where it is due. With a sudden shot of modesty, he says: 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (the leading college of furniture design). However, he is also unremittingly critical of those craftsmen who 'are trying to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also has little time for degree shows, in which students exhibit their work but at the same time are 'trying to make fashion statements. That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.'
Confident Hurst may be, even brusque, but you could never call him or his work pretentious. Indeed, his parting shot displays a welcome down- to-earth approach to his craft and a streak of humility strangely at odds with his earlier self- confidence. 'After all, I am only making furniture,' he says as I make my exit.",C1,"{'title': '62.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""The Cabinet-Maker\nCharles Hurst makes a living from perfectly crafted furniture Joanna Watt meets him\nCharles Hurst gives the impression of being a man in a hurry.

With a sudden shot of modesty, he says: 'There are people far better than me. I can admire other people. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham' (the leading college of furniture design). However, he is also unremittingly critical of those craftsmen who 'are trying to be artists and take a year to make one piece.' He also has little time for degree shows, in which students exhibit their work but at the same time are 'trying to make fashion statements. That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something that people really can use.'\nConfident Hurst may be, even brusque, but you could never call him or his work pretentious. Indeed, his parting shot displays a welcome down- to-earth approach to his craft and a streak of humility strangely at odds with his earlier self- confidence. 'After all, I am only making furniture,' he says as I make my exit.""}"

"Blogging: Confessing to the world 

Some time ago, a website highlighted the risks of public check-ins – online announcements of your where-abouts. The site’s point was blunt: you may think you are just telling the world, ‘Hey, I’m at this place’ – but you are also advertising your out-and-about-ness to all kinds of people everywhere – not all of them people you might like to bump into. This appeared to confirm the growing awareness that there might be a downside to all the frantic sharing the web has enabled. The vast new opportunities to publish any and every aspect of our lives to a potentially global audience hold out all sorts of tantalising possibilities: Wealth! Fame! So we plunge into the maelstrom of the internet, tossing confessions, personal photos and stories into the digital vortex. Too late we realise that the water is crowded and treacherous – and we are lost. 
Depressing? Perhaps, but don’t give up. This future has a map, drawn for us years ago by a reckless group of online pioneers. In the early days of the web, they sailed these waters and located all the treacherous shoals. They got fired from their jobs, found and lost friends and navigated celebrity’s temptations and perils – all long before the invention of social networking. These pioneers, the first wave of what we now call bloggers, have already been where the rest of us seem to be going. Before their tales scroll off our collective screen, it’s worth spending a little time with them. After all, those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repost it. 
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began posting to the ‘WWW’, as it was then known, something inhabited mostly by grad students, scientists and a handful of precocious teens like him. The web had been invented at CERN, the international physics lab in Switzerland, so researchers could more easily share their work. Hall saw something else: an opportunity to share his life. Link by link, he built a hypertext edifice of autobiography, a dense thicket of verbal self-exposure leavened with photos and art. In January 1996, on a dare, he began posting a daily blog, and readers flocked to the spectacle of a reckless young man pushing the boundaries of this new medium in every direction at once. 
Hall’s ethos was absolute: cross his path and you could appear on his site; no topic was taboo. Certainly, this was the work of an exhibitionist, but there was also a rigour and beauty to his project that only a snob would refuse to call art. One day though, visitors to Hall’s site discovered his home page gone, replaced with a single anguished video titled Dark Night. His story tumbled out; he’d fallen spectacularly in love, but when he started writing about it on his site he was told ‘either the blog goes, or I do’. He’d published his life on the internet and, Hall protested, ‘it makes people not trust me’. The blog went, but the dilemma persists. Sharing online is great. But if you expect your song of yourself to ‘make people want to be with you’, you’ll be disappointed. 
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young web worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. Occasionally, she wrote about her job at a software company. One day an anonymous colleague sent the address of Armstrong’s blog to every vice president at her company – including some whom she’d mocked – and that was the end of her job. Those who study the peculiar social patterns of the networked world have a term to describe what was at work here. They call it the ‘online distribution effect’: that feeling so many of us have that we can get away with saying things online that we’d never dream of saying in person. But our digital lives are interwoven with our real lives. When we pretend otherwise, we risk making terrible, life-changing mistakes. 
Armstrong’s saga had a happy ending. Though she was upset by the experience and stopped blogging for several months afterwards, she ended up getting married and restarting her blog with a focus on her new family. Today she is a star in the burgeoning ranks of ‘mommy bloggers’ and her writing supports her house hold.

"Title: In his novel 'Animal Farm' George Orwell wrote 'All men are equal but some are more equal than others'. How true is this today? 
 
Once the American president John Kennedy said something about the issue which will be discussed in this essay. His point was that one should not ask what the United Stated can do for them but what they can do for the United States. So, in the ideal situation one should contribute to the society they live in without expecting any reward at all. But as far as anyone has financial obligations, such as bills, rents, taxes, etc. this idea cannot be applied in real life. Besides, there is no living creature, at least not a human being, who can be made to work without and reward, whether it is financial or of some other kind. Of course, when stating this we should say that it refers to the present only it was not so long ago when slavery existed. Yet, slaves were at least given food, so even they got some kind of stimulation .
From the things mentioned above a very obvious conclusion can be drawn that in order to meet their needs people go to work and get a certain financial reward for the job they do. But here arises the more important issue of how much exactly should a person get for his or her contribution to society, or in other words who contributes more to society? Doctors or businessmen? At first sight it is clear that doctors should get the highest financial reward because there is no need to question their contribution to society, at all. But it is common knowledge that businessmen earn a lot more than doctors. However, this fact can be easily explained .
Businessmen are not paid by somebody else for their job. That is, they hind of personal reward themselves, so that is not a good example of fair distribution of remuneration. If we go back to the doctors again, it turns out that in some countries, particularly those of Eastern Europe, they get even less than skilled manual workers, whose job is not of primary importance to society but who work in the private sector, so if everything works right (which is often not the case in Bulgaria) the more they produce, the more they are likely to get as a financial reward. So, it turns out that the meaning of the word ""contribution"" has to be redefined for every particular society .
In addition, I would like to mention two more burning issues: pensions and women's payment, including child benefits. People who are retired evidently do not contribute much to the society, however they have done so far the most part of their lives and in my opinion, although they do not have the needs of a young person, they still deserve an honourable place in society. When mentioning women I mean that in some countries they are not equally paid with men even though they do exactly the same job. Besides, how can one estimate the contribution of a mother by paying her child benefits which are not enough even for a pair of baby's shoes .
To conclude with, people's financial reward is often not commensurate with their contribution to society. However, there was one tiny bit in the statement discussed. It says ""the society they live in"". So, it is not their fault if they live in the wrong society, that fails to provide them with what they really deserve .",B2,"{'title': '013_BGSU1184.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: In his novel \'Animal Farm\' George Orwell wrote \'All men are equal but some are more equal than others\'.

"Title: Should military service be compulsory in your country or should the army of your country consist of only professional soldiers? Discuss. 
 
In china, the PLA was consisted of only professional soldiers. But in many other countries, military service is compulsory and every citizen will have to proform as a soldier for several years. especially young university students. And in my opinion. military service should be compulsory .
There are several reasons why I think so. First, China, as the largest country of East Asia, had the widest borderline. To keep the whole borderline safe is not an easy thing. It need a large military force to be on duty all the time. But the soldiers sent to a certain place may not be familiar with the environment. Even they are professional soldiers, they may probably meet some troubles. If military service was compulsory, the border line can then be guarded by soldiers selected from local people who were familiar with local environment. And they can certainly do the job better than soliers from other places . .
Second, nowadays' young man are lack of life experience. They often care little about others and lack of discipline. Some of them even had never had any hardship and always waste things. Although Chinese government forced every university student to have a month's military training, it had little effect. People can't be changed in only a month. Comparing to these young man. those who had joined the army and serviced as professional soldiers are much more disciplinal and energetic .
So just imagine that if all the youngsters will have to serve in the military for several years, will it still be so many problems about youngster? 
Third, although the world is peace now, it still has the possibility of breaking out a war. And after so many years of disarmament, china's present military forces may not be enough for a war. But if military service was compulsory, those people who bad had military training can form a great military force at any time. That means almost every citizen can be the part of resistance to the invasion. Such things had happened once during the Second World War, when the Japanese army invaded China. At that time, almost everyone: soldiers, guerrillas and even citizens fought against the Japanese invader. And everyone may know that we won the war and defeated Japanese invader successfully .
Forth, armies formed by professional soldiers often developed slowly. Because every soldier had the same training and this made them always thought and acted in the same way. For this ""the army had few good commanders and new tactics. This will cause the army losing the ability of fighting. Now the PLA was starting a 
revolution, ""trying to avoid such situation. In fact, I think the best and easiest solution is to let military service be compulsory .
Although letting military service be compulsory has so many advantages, it also has disadvantages comparing to forming the army consist of professional soldiers .

"Our right to a fair trial, which underpins criminal law in the United Kingdom, the USA and many other nations, can be traced back to Magna Carta in 1215.
The Great Charter defined a person's right not to be imprisoned 'but by the lawful judgment of his peers'. Down the years our legal rights have continued to evolve, and some remarkable events have helped shape the law as it stands today
Before Magna Carta a barbaric system of justice held sway in Britain and across much of Europe.
Between the ninth and 13th centuries a person's guilt or innocence was determined by trial by fire or water. Suspects were burnt with hot metal, or else bound and thrown into a pool, and it was left to God to spare the innocent. Though discredited now, trial by ordeal was considered highly effective in this superstitious era as most guilty criminals preferred to confess and so avoid trial. The practice, overseen by the church, was banned by Pope Innocent III in 1215.
Until the mid-17th Century someone accused of a crime could find themselves facing another terrifying ordeal: torture.
In the century after 1540, 81 torture warrants were issued in England. To extract information, criminal suspects were suspended from manacles or stretched on the notorious rack. Things changed after the trial of John Archer in May 1640. Accused of high treason after his arrest during a riot, Archer, a glove-maker, was tortured on the rack.

"Photography

When a photographer takes a photograph, he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills, personal views and experience, together with a set of social and cultural norms. And in the course of this book we shall see how these factors not only affect the style, content and expression of a photograph, but also how those images are perceived and responded to by the viewer. For example, we might consider that the casual reader of a newspaper will have an implicit understanding of the photographic images reproduced on the page. But rather than accepting the photograph at face value, we might question whether it accurately recorded the scene as it would have looked at the time. Or, in contrast, does it communicate the photographer's point of view? Is it the precise instant recorded that is of particular importance, or should the photograph on the page be understood as a symbol to represent a state of affairs in the world?

More than a game

Sport for me has always been more than just a game. The most successful people in sport have total self-belief. You need tunnel vision if you want to succeed in sport. There's only one route to being the best and you have to put everything else to one side. Sport is ruthless and no one else is going to do it for you. It's sink or swim.
Sport has taught me personal discipline and determination, but it can also teach you the benefits of working as one of a team. My sport allows and encourages you to excel individually, yet it is a team game and you have to balance these two aspects. It's very much like life - you can succeed as an individual, but you must never forget there are others around you.
Sport has given me a great deal - and not just financially. It has opened doors for me and opened my eyes, and I've seen things around the world that others will never see. But you also have to give up a lot for those perks.

Tuning in

Some experiences etch themselves so sharply on our memory that they form islands of clarity in our recollection. For me, such a momentous occasion took place one night in California many years ago, when I lay awake listening to the rapturous strains of a mockingbird singing from an invisible location in one of the tall trees that were dotted around the suburban neighbourhood. I don't suffer from insomnia - it was the exquisite artistry of the singer that kept me awake. As I followed his intricately woven melodies, I found myself drawn into an unexpected aesthetic environment. In order to follow the patterns that issued from the bird, I had to call on my experience of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird had me convinced that I was being treated to an ad lib performance of the most breathtaking improvisational acrobatics. I groaned and I cheered as one improbable musical variation followed another through the open window where I lay listening, until finally I fell asleep.",C2,"{'title': '61.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Photography\n\nWhen a photographer takes a photograph, he or she makes a selection of visual information that is determined by his or her technical and aesthetic skills, personal views and experience, together with a set of social and cultural norms.

"POWER DRESSING

EVERY SUMMER, the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens. They re-enact the mystery that tormented Charles Darwin to his dying day: how in this competitive world, where nature as Tennyson said - is red in tooth and claw, could birds have evolved such an obvious extravagance? How do they get away with it? The zoologist Marion Petrie and her colleagues of the Open University are now exploiting the quasi-wild conditions of Whipsnade to try, a century after Darwin’s death, to settle the matter.
Darwin argued that living creatures came to be the way they are by evolution, rather than by special creation, and that the principal mechanism of evolution was natural selection. That is, in a crowded and hence competitive world, the individuals best suited to the circumstances - the ‘fittest' - are the most likely to survive and have offspring.
But the implication is that fittest would generally mean toughest, swiftest, cleverest, most alert. The peacocks tail, by contrast, was at best a waste of space and in practice a severe encumbrance, and Darwin felt obliged to invoke what he felt was a separate mechanism of evolution, which he called 'sexual selection’. The driving mechanism was simply that females liked — in his words - 'beauty for beauty’s sake’.
But Darwin’s friend and collaborator, Alfred Russel Wallace, though in many ways more 'romantic' than Darwin, was in others even more Darwinian. 'Beauty for beauty's sake’ he wanted nothing of. If peahens chose cocks with the showiest trains, he felt, then it must be that they knew what they were about. The cocks must have some other quality, which was not necessarily obvious to the human observer, but which the hens themselves could appreciate. According to Wallace, then, the train was not an end in itself, but an advertisement for some genuine contribution to survival.
Now, 100 years later, the wrangle is still unresolved, for the natural behaviour of peafowl is much harder to study than might be imagined. But 200
birds at Whipsnade, which live like wild birds yet are used to human beings, offer unique opportunities for study. Marion Petrie and her colleagues at
Whipsnade have identified two main questions. First, is the premise correct - do peahens really choose the males with the showiest trains? And, secondly, do the peacocks with the showiest trains have some extra, genuinely advantageous quality, as Wallace supposed, or is it really all show, as Darwin felt?
In practice, the mature cocks display in groups at a number of sites around Whipsnade, and the hens judge one against the other. Long observation from hides, backed up by photographs, suggests that the hens really do like the showiest males. What seems to count is the number of eye-spots on the train, which is related to its length; the cocks with the most eye-spots do indeed attract the most mates.
But whether the males with the best trains are also 'better' in other ways remains to be pinned down. William Hamilton of Oxford University has put forward the hypothesis that showy male birds in general, of whatever species, are the most parasite-free, and that their plumage advertises their disease-free state. There is evidence that this is so in other birds. But Dr Petrie and her colleagues have not been able to assess the internal parasites in the Whipsnade peacocks to test this hypothesis. This year, however, she is comparing the offspring of cocks that have in the past proved attractive to hens with the offspring of cocks that hens find unattractive. Do the children of the attractive cocks grow faster? Are they more healthy? If so, then the females' choice will be seen to be utilitarian after all, just as Wallace predicted. 
There is a final twist to this continuing story. The great mathematician and biologist R A Fisher in the thirties proposed what has become known as ‘Fisher's Runaway'. Just suppose, for example, that for whatever reason - perhaps for a sound 'Wallacian’ reason a female first picks a male with a slightly better tail than the rest. The sons of that mating will inherit their father’s tail, and the daughters will inherit their mother's predilection for long tails. This is how the runaway begins. Within each generation, the males with the longest tails will get most mates and leave most offspring, and the females predilection for long tails will increase commensurately. Modern computer models show that such a feedback mechanism would alone be enough to produce a peacocks tail. Oddly, too, this would vindicate Darwin’s apparently fanciful notion - once the process gets going, the females would indeed be selecting 'beauty for beauty’s sake’.",C1,"{'title': '949455bc-d479-4910-bc2c-e9c99af24188.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""POWER DRESSING\n\nEVERY SUMMER, the peacocks that roam free within Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire expose their magnificent trains to the critical and often disdainful gaze of the hens.

"BRINGING UP BADGERS

‘What now?’ was my immediate thought, as one of my helpers canned a cardboard box towards me. Since my husband Derek and I turned our dairy farm in Somerset into an ‘open farm’ six years ago, we’ve established a reputation for looking after orphaned animals. But the noise coming from die box — a cross between a cackle and a bark - was not one I recognised, so it was with great interest that I peered in to see three small grey badger cubs, each no more than eight inches long. Their coats (later to reveal fleas) were like velvet, and milky-coloured eyes looked up at me from three tiny black-and-white striped heads.
I had never seen badger cubs before. As most of them are born between mid-January and mid-March, they usually spend their early life underground and, if orphaned, die of starvation, never to be found. These three had been brought in by building contractors; while laying drain pipes,their machinery had bored into the sett before they realised it. The mother was found dead with her babies still suckling her.
I could see they were healthy and well but they were cold and whimpering. After defleaing them, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and installed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. Initially I used a syringe to feed them but each cub had to be wiped with a warm cloth first to simulate the sensation of the mother licking them. This encouraged them to empty their bowels and bladder. For the first two or three days they were fed every four hours.
Within a week the cubs had progressed to drinking from a bottle and were moving around, albeit shakily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute ‘mum’, they seemed very contented. Three weeks after their arrival, however, I noticed that Willow seemed lethargic, although he was still taking food as normal. It was a warning sign. I should have reacted straightaway; not realising its importance, I awoke the next morning to find him dead.
The vets post mortem revealed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle feeding any animal it is important not to let it drink too fast, as liquid can overflow into the lungs. In Willows case this had caused an infection that would have been difficult to rectify, even with the help of antibiotics, in one so small.
Disheartened by my failure, I continued rearing the others. But fate works in strange ways: six days later a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. Behind some silage bags he had discovered a single male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return; the area had been disturbed too much and already the cub was cold and hungry.
Willow II joined the fold. At six weeks, he was about two weeks younger than the females and over the next few days I discovered why his mother had left him. Never had anything been so difficult to feed. To place the bottles teat in his mouth and cajole him into drinking I had to keep moving it around and squeezing it. After a full 10 minutes he would latch on to it as if he had not drunk all day. By the end of April the females were weaned on to creamed rice and then literally anything. It was to be a different story for Willow. He was happy to give up the bottle but could not master the habit of eating without walking through his food, tipping it over or just sitting in it. Eventually I offered him a sausage, which little by little was chewed, played with and finally eaten. After a week of sausages he was ready to move on to something else.
At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast; a meat and vegetable meal for lunch and fruit and nuts, cheese, hard boiled eggs and sunflower seeds in the evening. The usual diet for badgers is 60 per cent earthworms, plus beetles and bugs, baby rabbits, mice and voles and even shoots or roots of plants. Certainly my badgers were much better off than other cubs that year; the summer was exceptionally hot and digging for earthworms must have been almost impossible.
By August my foundlings had begun to turn nocturnal and would go for walks only at dusk or late at night. We often went through the cider orchard; in its long grass, everyone was fair game. The cubs would get excited, ruffle up their fur so that they looked like snowballs and chase each other’s tails. As ‘human badgers’ we were included in this sport. I learnt to avoid those playful charges that ended with a sharp nip, but Derek accompanied us only occasionally and so never grasped this skill: his reactions to being caught were sometimes as colourful as his bruises.
It was during two of these late-night walks in the very dry period that I spotted odder badgers in our field. Presumably they were having to extend their territories to find enough food, although badgers are very territorial and will kill others that wander into their territory. We were even warned that they would climb into our badger pen and kill the cubs, so sheet metal was placed over the gate to make it as inaccessible as possible.
The local press took some pictures of me walking the badgers, and such was the response that we started an appeal to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to move into. With advice freely given, we designed our badgers’ new home. Daniel, one of our sons, drew up the plans and we built a sett complete with tunnels, an enclosure and a badger gate facing the same way as their nightly walks.
It had three chambers, one slightly larger than the others, with a glass side to enable people to see into the sett from a darkened enclosure. As the sett began to take shape, the badgers would explore it before going on their walks. Eventually walks were forgotten in the excitement of climbing through the tunnels and sorting out bedding.
The cost of the building work was far more than we envisaged but a local bus company (the aptly named Badgerline) sponsored part of the appeal, and local firms donated building materials. Everyone, it seemed, wanted to see the badgers with a home of their own.
Early one evening they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later I crept back to see if all was well, to be met with the sight of three badgers curled up in their chambers sound asleep.
These days my walks with them are not as regular, especially as they are not fully awake until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally (she has joined a neighbouring sett) but

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
It is of course always difficult to agree with assertions as categoric as this one. But we should perhaps first examine the aim of university studies before we discuss the statement in itself .
In my opinion, it would be a mistake to consider that university studies should prepare students for the ""real world"". One goes to university -I hope - because he is interested in a particular subject and wants to know more about it. He will of course learn things that he will never need in his professional career, but you expect from a mathematician that he knows how to calculate, even if he will rely on computers in his profession. Moreover, it is sometimes very difficult to know what your degree will lead you to do in life. Someone with a degree in general medicine might become a general practitioner or a researcher; or even change several times of job in the course of his life. Therefore, if one wants university to prepare him for the ""real world"", it should only learn him to be ambivalent. The problem is now to know if it is something one can learn .
As I suggested earlier, one shouldn't expect, when going to university, to learn how to behave in life the same way as a technician can learn how to deal with a machine. In fact the most significant thing I will have learned at my university is to do things by myself. But I will deal with this point later .
An important thing to mention here is that the average length of university studies in Belgium is of four years (even three in England). In such a short period of time, it is of course impossible to get all the knowledge one will need for the rest of his life. People who have already graduated have now to retrain. If a university cannot give to someone all the knowledge he needs, how on earth could it prepare him to deal with the complexity of the ""real world""?
In fact I understand the word ""university"" as a place where one has to prove something. Of course, there are still teachers, but they are not as interested in pedagogy as secondary school teachers are. They give their lessons and it is for the students to show their ability to deal with the (most of of the time broad) subject. They have to show how they can assimilate the subject, but also how they can reorganize it, and think about it, and adapt themselves to every situation; in one word, how they can work by themselves. If they can do that, they are capable of holding a leading place in the society .
It is therefore that a university degree has a very good value and that they are praised everywhere. It is not only because you have learned something, but also because you can still learn something, because you can judge any situation rightly .
For all these reasons - and for one more - I strongly disagree with the statement I have just been discussing. My last reason is the following one: one may not consider a university degree only as a means to make money. A university is, above all, a place where you learn to think and to respect every opinion and every thing. This makes its value and the value of its degree .",C1,"{'title': '146_FRUL2002.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. \n \nIt is of course always difficult to agree with assertions as categoric as this one. But we should perhaps first examine the aim of university studies before we discuss the statement in itself .\nIn my opinion, it would be a mistake to consider that university studies should prepare students for the ""real world"". One goes to university -I hope - because he is interested in a particular subject and wants to know more about it. He will of course learn things that he will never need in his professional career, but you expect from a mathematician that he knows how to calculate, even if he will rely on computers in his profession. Moreover, it is sometimes very difficult to know what your degree will lead you to do in life. Someone with a degree in general medicine might become a general practitioner or a researcher; or even change several times of job in the course of his life. Therefore, if one wants university to prepare him for the ""real world"", it should only learn him to be ambivalent. The problem is now to know if it is something one can learn .\nAs I suggested earlier, one shouldn\'t expect, when going to university, to learn how to behave in life the same way as a technician can learn how to deal with a machine. In fact the most significant thing I will have learned at my university is to do things by myself. But I will deal with this point later .\nAn important thing to mention here is that the average length of university studies in Belgium is of four years (even three in England). In such a short period of time, it is of course impossible to get all the knowledge one will need for the rest of his life. People who have already graduated have now to retrain. If a university cannot give to someone all the knowledge he needs, how on earth could it prepare him to deal with the complexity of the ""real world""?\nIn fact I understand the word ""university"" as a place where one has to prove something. Of course, there are still teachers, but they are not as interested in pedagogy as secondary school teachers are. They give their lessons and it is for the students to show their ability to deal with the (most of of the time broad) subject. They have to show how they can assimilate the subject, but also how they can reorganize it, and think about it, and adapt themselves to every situation; in one word, how they can work by themselves.

'Bollywood', which is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, makes almost 1,000 films a year. Since making its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films.

"The new emphasis on artillery reflected the mastery of gun founding in England, another development pushed by Henry VIII. It also reflected the need for a naval force to defend the kingdom against European rivals, as Henry adopted his radical new foreign policy, based on religious grounds.

The mobility, heavy bow guns and small target area of the French galleys made them very dangerous opponents.
As rebuilt, the Mary Rose was expected to fight using all her guns, sailing down towards the enemy, firing the ahead weapons, before turning to present one broadside, the stern, the other broadside and then making off to reload, while other ships took her place.

"The Young Achiever of the Year

Kal Kaur Rai has always been interested in fashion and has just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Ever since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her hard-working parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree.

After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked. She started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make things for them. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. They were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan and begin her own womenswear label.

Kal's parents were not angry about her career change and said they would support her, which really pleased her. Her clothes are now on sale in over 70 stores and her business has an income of over £500,000.

Ever since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and designed patterns. She never told her hard-working parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to turn her hobby into a career. She thought they expected her to go into a more established business, so she went to university to do a management degree.\n\nAfter university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising agency. She had to attend industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she liked. She started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make things for them. She then found a small shop in London willing to take her designs on a sale-or- return basis. They were very popular and nothing came back. This encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan and begin her own womenswear label.\n\nKal's parents were not angry about her career change and said they would support her, which really pleased her.

"How to Write Poetry

Telling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day, but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face. Setting oneself up as a know-all is dangerous, so I have decided to side-step the whole issue by saying that, for someone just beginning to write, no advice can be a substitute for abundant reading, extensive writing, and the freeing of the imagination and spirit in whatever way seems fruitful, barring total anarchy. Some people need their life to be reasonably secure before a poem will come; others can write their way out of misery. Some write to a timetable: others wait for some moment of crystallisation, a brainwave or slow dawning. All are right, providing they are not echoing some prescriptive score. And it’s this finding of a tune which is important, hearing the still small voice inside yourself and feeding it, and watering it, and letting it out for air from time to time; one day it’ll be old enough to take care of itself.

The Short Story

In the short story there is no room for overcrowding with too many characters, slabs of lengthy narrative, prolonged reminiscence or retrospection. Flashbacks must be fleeting, and only used if there is no other way to throw light on an issue. One effective way to do this is through a flash of memory in the leading character's mind; the recollection or reminder of an incident or scene, which stirred the current conflict. Such a recollection can get the story on its way or take it a big step forward at a crucial moment, but never at any time must it be allowed to put a brake on the action. In this respect, dialogue is more useful than many aspiring authors realise. Two voices in discussion can reveal two sides of a question in far less time than it takes to explain it from only one person’s viewpoint. It also avoids unnecessary wordage and holds or increases a reader’s interest. Overwriting can kill a short story from the start, but this doesn't mean that brevity must reduce it to the level of a synopsis. Conflict and action must be as well sustained in a short story as in a novel, but in the short story the art lies in making every word count in a compact space.

Screenplays

Anyone who knows how to play chess will understand how to write a screenplay for a film. Most chess players stumble from beginning to end. We don’t know much, but we know enough to play. We move without really knowing what’s going to happen further on in the game. Maybe we can see one or two moves ahead, and, if we can, were pleased by our uncanny ability to see even that far ahead. Better than the days when we couldst see ahead at all - when we were playing blindly.
Over time, as we learned more about playing chess, we made a startling revelation: chess depends more upon long-term strategy than upon short-term tactics. Up till then, we’d been happy with a rather short-sighted approach. Suddenly, we became aware of ‘the big picture’. We began to see the game as a whole, not just a series of individual moves. And once we saw the game as a whole, we began to see patterns emerge in the play. Gambits, they call them. And the patterns have names, such as openings, middle games and end games. In chess, as in screenplay writing, the more often you play, the more aware you become of its complexities.

Looking at Writing

‘Man has an instinctive tendency to speak, as we see in the babble of our young children; while no child has an instinctive tendency to bake, brew, or write’. More than a century ago, Charles Darwin got it right: language is a human instinct, but written language is not. Language is found in all societies, present and past. Although languages change, they do not improve: English is no more complex than the languages of Stone Age tribes; modern English is not an advance of Old English. All healthy children master their language without lessons or corrections. When children are thrown together without a usable language, they invent one of their own. Compare all this with writing.
Writing systems have been invented only infrequently in history. They originated only in a few complex civilisations and they started off code and slowly improved over the millennia. Until recently, most children never learned to read or write; even with today’s universal education, many children struggle and fail. A group of children is no more likely to invent an alphabet than it is to invent the internal combustion engine. Children are wired for sound, but print is an optional accessory that must be painstakingly bolted on. We need to understand how the contraption called writing works, how the minds of the children work, how to get the two to mesh.",C2,"{'title': '938d307e-48ef-42f5-9f4b-a6d0c25752a3.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""How to Write Poetry\n\nTelling people how to write poetry is a bit like frolicking through a minefield: spontaneity is the order of the day, but one false step and a dozen certainties will blow up in your face.

"Mr Duncan? Come in please. Mr Wilson will see you now.'
'Thank you.' John Duncan stood up and walked nervously towards the door. He was a tall, thin man, about forty-five years old, in an old grey suit. It was his best suit, but it was ten years old now. He had grey hair and glasses. His face looked sad and tired.
Inside the room, a man stood up to welcome him. 'Mr Duncan? Pleased to meet you. My name's David Wilson. This is one of our chemists, Mary Carter.'
John Duncan shook hands with both of them, and sat down. It was a big office, with a thick carpet on the floor and beautiful pictures on the walls. David Wilson was a young man, in an expensive black suit. He had a big gold ring on one finger. He smiled at John.
'I asked Miss Carter to come because she's one of our best chemists. She discovered our wonderful new paint, in fact. When... I mean, if you come to work here, you will work with her.'
'Oh, I see.' John looked at Mary. She was older than Wilson - about thirty-five, perhaps - with short brown hair, and a pretty, friendly face. She was wearing a white coat with a lot of pens in the top pocket. She smiled at him kindly, but John felt miserable.
I'll never get this job, he thought. I'm too old! Employers want younger people these days.

"Blacksmiths

THROUGHOUT the ages, iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination, and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths enjoyed the same status as doctors and astrologers, because they were the sole providers of weapons, armour and farming tools.
They have also been féted as artises. Eighteenth-century smiths produced the wonderfully baroque ironwork for St Paul’s Cathedral. The sinuous metalwork of French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture was always the work of a talented blacksmith.
But practitioners of these ancient skills had become almost extinct in Britain by the late 1960s, for heavy industry had ceased to have any use for them, and towerblock architects rarely used anything as graceful and pleasing as a wrought-iron handrail.
Over the past 10 years, however, there has been something of a revival - thanks to greater interest in decorative architecture and a less conservative approach to interior design. Even so, much of the work looks surprisingly clichéd: manufacturers of gates and balconies still advertise their wares as ‘classical’ or ‘Victorian-style’. You cant walk into a trendy design store without being assailed by rusty candlesticks with dangly bits.
Thankfully, alternatives exist and a series of events over the next few weeks aims to promote the blacksmiths craft. The first of these, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the
Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey.
Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says: ‘We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, because, in a sense, both the general public and blacksmiths have had their blinkers removed.’ Power tools have liberated smiths from all that labouring over a hot anvil, and they can now bend, split, twist and spot-weld the metal with relative ease. ‘In short,’ says Dawson, ‘these artists now have a material which allows them to express themselves.’
About 250 pieces have been produced for the show, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase. Reserve prices start at £90 and climb well into four figures. Most of the money raised will go to individual makers, ‘but a percentage of every sale will be retained by the Association for the promotion of good ironwork,’ says Dawson.
His own contributions consist of an eight-foot gate, and a standard lamp topped with a mouth-blown glass shade.
‘My style results from just allowing steel to bend and flow into shape when its hot. It’s a bit like drawing with metal in space,’ he says.
Many of the artists admit to being fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are relatively malleable when cold, iron and steel are a tougher, more demanding medium. Susan May, a jeweller by training, says, ‘It’s quite magical, because its incredibly soft when its hot, but as soon as it cools down, it becomes really rigid and immovable again.’
Ann Catrin Evans’ mild steel door-knockers and handles seem to have been inspired by those bleak castles that are a stock feature of horror films. One of her designs is shaped like a ball and chain, another like a Celtic cross. ‘I love the fact that steel is cold and hard,’ she says. ‘And the way it feels as though its there forever.’
No other base metal can have given man as much visual pleasure, or a greater feeling of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are good, to say the least as long as we don’t have to look at any more rusty Candlesticks, that is.",C1,"{'title': '54dc1e60-1b36-4ea8-aa77-d4bb0bf94dfb.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Blacksmiths\n\nTHROUGHOUT the ages, iron has exerted a powerful pull on the human imagination, and the men who work it have often been regarded as much more than skilled craftsmen.

"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers carry pictures which intrude into people's privacy and break the newspaper editors' code of practice. Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion, this is not typical. More usually, great damage is done to [line 6: beginning] individuals in the public eye when they see their most [line 6: end] private moments captured on the front page. Yet very few call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organisation that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. 
Rarely, if ever, are these pictures in the public interest. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where, to quote the code of practice, 'there is a reasonable expectation of privacy', she had good cause for complaint, but she didn't take any action. 
That the PCC did not launch an investigation itself is a scandal. It should also be looking into the outrageous story published recently about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the famous actress, has held back from making a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC [line 25: beginning] take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks? [line 25: end]
To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. These would be reported by their rivals and broadcast on TV and radio. The public would not be sympathetic and editors would have to refuse to publish such material. Even photographers would be affected, no longer finding it financially possible to spend their days hidden behind trees waiting to snap unsuspecting celebrities. 
If the PCC decided to take on this role of 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several problems. How would it decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? Should it approach the victim and encourage him or her to make a complaint? And if the person involved still refused to do anything, should it proceed nevertheless? In addition, celebrities and members of royalty might well expect that any story involving them would be taken up, and then be outraged to find it wasn't. Above all, the role itself is too enormous. How could the PCC realistically monitor the whole of the British press: national, regional and magazines? 
Then there is the embarrassment factor to consider. However seriously someone's privacy has been invaded, would they really want the further embarrassment of an investigation? I suspect the majority simply want to put it behind them and get on with their lives. Of course, one or two may have other reasons for keeping quiet. A worse story may exist, that they have managed to keep from the press, and they realise that this may also become public knowledge if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. 
One British comedian also suffered at the hands of the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor more recently, when he and his family were again victims of a sneak photographer during a family holiday. His reason for this was fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would re-run the pictures with a new story about his 'fury', saying that they thought it was just a bit of fun, and that, being a film star who made comedies, they thought he had a sense of humour. This fear is understandable. People believe they will again become targets if they dare to challenge the tabloids.

How would it decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? Should it approach the victim and encourage him or her to make a complaint? And if the person involved still refused to do anything, should it proceed nevertheless? In addition, celebrities and members of royalty might well expect that any story involving them would be taken up, and then be outraged to find it wasn't. Above all, the role itself is too enormous. How could the PCC realistically monitor the whole of the British press: national, regional and magazines? \nThen there is the embarrassment factor to consider. However seriously someone's privacy has been invaded, would they really want the further embarrassment of an investigation? I suspect the majority simply want to put it behind them and get on with their lives. Of course, one or two may have other reasons for keeping quiet. A worse story may exist, that they have managed to keep from the press, and they realise that this may also become public knowledge if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. \nOne British comedian also suffered at the hands of the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn't complain then, nor more recently, when he and his family were again victims of a sneak photographer during a family holiday. His reason for this was fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would re-run the pictures with a new story about his 'fury', saying that they thought it was just a bit of fun, and that, being a film star who made comedies, they thought he had a sense of humour. This fear is understandable. People believe they will again become targets if they dare to challenge the tabloids. It is hard to see an easy solution to this serious problem. ""}"

"Britain ruled British North America. When more English people started arriving, the French people became afraid of losing their language and way of living. The Aboriginal peoples were also unhappy about living on special lands set aside for them. Their way of living also was in danger of being lost. Many people wanted change.
Before 1867, Canada was called British North America (BNA). It was not a country. It was divided into areas called colonies. A colony is an area under the control of another country. Britain was the mother country of these colonies. It defended its colonies in British North America and had a special trade relationship with them. In this unit, you will learn the story of how the colonies of British North America joined together to become the country of Canada. This joining together of colonies into a country is called Confederation.
Before Confederation, British North America had six different colonies. There were also other areas under the control of the British government but they were not colonies. We can study these colonies and areas better by dividing them into regions. A region is an area of land that has a similar geography, people and activities. Different colonies in the same region often had similar ideas and ways of living. These ideas and ways of living were different from people that lived in other regions.

"Writing Reviews

Frank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner’s point of view.

Most reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life. There are deadlines, there are restrictions, normally quite severe, on their length; and when published they claim houseroom only for as long as the newspaper they are printed in - a day or a week, at most a month. Moreover, the literary status of reviews tends to be settled by their ephemerality. It is usually supposed, not only by the public but, quite often, by the writers themselves, that reviewing is work that nobody would do if there weren't some reason — shortage of cash would he cited most often, though another good reason is that you can't work all day on a novel or a ‘serious’
book of any sort - which prevents them from occupying their time with something more valuable.
Yet reviewing is a skilled and multi-faceted job. It is one thing to be bright, brisk and summarily fair in the six or eight hundred words of an ordinary newspaper review, quite another to control, without looseness of argument, the six or eight thousand words sometimes allowed by international journals. And the fifteen hundred words of a leading piece in the weekly magazines present some of the problems of both short and long. Not that length is the only consideration. For one thing, the reviewer obviously needs to think about the probable audience, the weekend skimmer at one end of the scale, the person already interested enough in the subject to tackle a serious review-article at the other. Finally, a reviewer needs to know quite a bit about quite a number of things; and must be able to write prose that intelligent people can understand and enjoy. It follows almost infallibly that the reviewer will be somebody who writes other things besides reviews.
The American novelist Johh Updike, who rather looks down on criticism — ‘hugging the shore’ he calls it - nevertheless enjoys some coastal reviewing in the intervals between his transoceanic novel-writing. Understandably reluctant to allow even his less ambitious voyages to go without any permanent record, he gathers together his every review, however short, into volumes with mildly self-deprecating titles. It might be thought that lesser persons should accept ephemerality as the penalty appropriate to their coastal caution, but it is hand to see why, if they can get away with it, they shouldn't be allowed to enjoy the measure of permanence, and the measure of vanity, proper to their station, especially if they believe that some of their best writing has been ‘buried’ in reviews. I admit to feeling this about my own work.
My own principal occupation has been academic, and most of my ‘serious’ books are recognisably academic products, the sort of thing professors like, and are expected to do as part of their jobs. However, the English-speaking world (I think fortunately) acknowledges nothing comparable to the sharp distinction people from other cultures make between reviewing and literary study — and so with us it is quite usual for the same people to do both. The days are gone when other academics reviled reviewer-professors for unseemly self-display, or waste of academic time, or betrayal of the dignity of their institutions. And complaints from non-professors, to the effect that the professors are taking the bread out of their mouths, are also less common than they were, partly because there is so much more reviewing nowadays that practically everyone can have some, partly, no doubt, because the bread is often such a meagre ration.
My own view is that these arrangements are good for both readers — since they can be fairly certain the reviewer has at least some idea what he is talking about — and professors, if only because the work helps to keep them sane. It also reminds them that they have a duty, easily neglected, to make themselves intelligible to non-professors. When talking among themselves they may feel some need to be impressively arcane, but when addressing intelligent non-professors they need to make sure they are communicating effectively.
Finally, it is clear that for a variety of reasons, and despite all that can be said to dignify it, reviewing must be a secondary occupation. It is something you can only do well enough if you are also doing something else well enough.",C2,"{'title': 'ce83167a-aa9d-46e1-ba78-f92017dd716a.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Writing Reviews\n\nFrank Kermode examines the craft of review-writing from a practitioner’s point of view.\n\nMost reviews are written and circulated under conditions which ensure that they have a very short active life.

"Confident people what's their secret?

Confident people may look as though they were born that way, but most will tell you that it's a skill they've learned because they had to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they did it.

A Jenny

When I left school I was very shy and I always thought I'd stay that way. I was about twenty-five when I was asked to help out at my daughter's school. I was sure I wouldn't cope, but I surprised myself by doing well and someone there suggested that I should do a university course.
There was a huge knot in my stomach the day I turned up for my first lecture. But my confidence gradually grew - I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was the turning point in my life that has helped everything else fall into place.

B Michaela

It all started four years ago when my father became ill and I had to take over the family business. I was so scared, I went over the top and became a bit too aggressive and impatient. I thought that was what confident people were like, but gradually I learned otherwise. To be confident you've got to believe in yourself.
If things get too demanding for me at work, I don't let myself feel guilty if I save a number of tasks until the next day. When I'm confronted with something difficult, I tell myself that I've got nothing to lose. It's fear that makes you lack confidence, so I'm always having quiet chats with myself to put aside those fears!

C Lisa

People think I'm very confident but, in fact, the calmer I look, the more terrified I really am. I've had to develop the ability to look confident because it's the most vital thing in TV. Interviewing people has helped me realise that most - if not all - of us get tense in important situations, and we feel calmer when we speak to someone who's genuinely friendly. The best ever piece of advice came from my mother when I was agonising as a teenager about wearing the right clothes. She simply cried, 'Who's looking at you? Everybody's too busy worrying about how they look.' I've found that's well worth remembering.
I also think you gain confidence by tackling things that scare you. When I took my driving test I was so nervous, but I passed. After that I felt sure that I'd never feel so frightened again, and I never have.

D Barbara

My confidence comes naturally from really enjoying the work I do, but it's something that I've built up over the years. If you just get on with it and learn from any mistakes you make, you're more confident the next time round. I work hard and I'm popular in the restaurant, but it's probable that one out of ten people doesn't like me. I don't let that affect me. You've got to like yourself for what you are, not try to be what others expect.
My company runs a lot of training courses, and going on those has built up my self-esteem. The company also encourages employees to set manageable targets. It helps no end if you can see you're achieving something tangible, rather than reaching for the stars all at once, and ending up with nothing but air!

E Kim

After I left college I worked for years as a secretary and would sit in meetings, not always agreeing with what was being said, but too scared to speak up. Eventually, I summoned up the confidence to start making my point. Even so, when I first worked in politics, I'd never spoken in public before and always used to shake like a leaf. I would say to myself, 'Don't be so silly. People do this every day of their lives, so there's no reason why you can't.' I also found it helpful to jot a few things down to refer to - rather like having a comfort blanket!

"Visit the Edinburgh Festival!

Every year, thousands of people come to Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, to be part of the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks every August and September the city is filled with actors and artists from all over the world. They come to Edinburgh for the biggest arts festival in Britain. During this time the streets of the city are alive with music and dance from early morning until late at night. You can even see artists painting pictures on the streets. One of the best parts of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students do comedy shows in small halls and cafes.
Tens of thousands of tourists come to the Festival to see new films and plays and hear music played by famous musicians. This year, you can see over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries.

"The Hotel Inspector

Sue Brown judges hotels for a living. Christopher Middleton watched her in action.

One minute into the annual inspection and things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel. Not that they know it yet. The receptionist reciting room rates over the phone to a potential guest is still blissfully unaware of the identity of the real guest she is doggedly ignoring. 'Hasn't even acknowledged us,' Sue Brown says out of the corner of her mouth. 'Very poor.' It is a classic arrival-phase error, and one that Sue has encountered scores of times in her 11 years as an inspector. 'But this isn't an ordinary three-star place,' she protests. 'It has three red stars, and I would expect better.'
To be the possessor of red stars means that the Globe is rated among the top 130 of the 4,000 listed in the hotel guide published by the organisation she works for. However, even before our frosty welcome, a chill has entered the air. Access from the car park has been via an unmanned door, operated by an impersonal buzzer, followed by a long, twisting, deserted corridor leading to the hotel entrance. 'Again, not what I had expected,' says Sue.
Could things get worse? They could. 'We seem to have no record of your booking,' announces the receptionist, in her best sing-song how-may-I-help-you voice.
It turns out that a dozen of the hotel's 15 rooms are unoccupied that night. One is on the top floor. It is not to the inspector's taste: stuffiness is one criticism, the other is a gaping panel at the back of the wardrobe, behind which is a large hole in the wall.
When she began her inspecting career, she named an early reputation for toughness. 'The Woman in Black, I was known as,' she recalls, 'which was funny, because I never used to wear black. And I've never been too tough.' Not that you would know it the next morning when, after paying her bill, she suddenly reveals her identity to the Globe's general manager, Robin Greaves.
From the look on his face, her arrival has caused terror.
Even before she says anything else, he expresses abject apologies for the unpleasant smell in the main lounge. 'We think there's a blocks drain there,' he sighs. 'The whole floor will probably have to come up.` Sue gently suggests that as well as sorting out the plumbing, he might also prevail upon his staff not to usher guests into the room so readily. 'Best, perhaps, to steer them to the other lounge.' she says. Greaves nods with glum enthusiasm and gamely takes notes. He has been at the Globe for only five months, and you can see him struggling to believe Sue when she says that this dissection of the hotel can only be for the good of the place in the long run.
Not that it's all on the negative side. Singled out for commendation are Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who dished out a sheaf of notes about the building's 400-year history. Dinner, too, has done enough to maintain the hotel's two-rosette food rating, thereby encouraging Greaves to push his luck a bit. 'So what do we have to do to get three rosettes?' he enquires. Sue's suggestions include: 'Not serve a pudding that collapses.' The brief flicker of light in Greaves' eyes goes out.
It is Sue Brown's unenviable job to voice the complaints the rest of us more cowardly consumers do not have the courage to articulate. 'Sometimes one can be treading on very delicate ground. I remember, in one case, a woman rang to complain I'd got her son the sack. All I could say was the truth, which was that he'd served me apple pie with his fingers.' Comeback letters involve spurious allegations of everything, from a superior attitude to demanding bribes. 'You come to expect it after a while, but it hurts every time,' she says.
Sue is required not just to relate her findings to the hotelier verbally, but also to send them a full written report. They are, after all, paying for the privilege of her putting them straight. (There is an annual fee for inclusion in the guide.) Nevertheless, being singled out for red-star treatment makes it more than worthwhile. So it is reassuring for Greaves to hear that Sue is not going to recommend that the Globe be stripped of its red stars. That is the good news. The bad is that another inspector will be back in the course of the next two months to make sure that everything has been put right. 'Good,' smiles Greaves unconvincingly. 'We'll look forward to that.'",C1,"{'title': '47.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""The Hotel Inspector\n\nSue Brown judges hotels for a living.

"Title: Should criminals be imprisoned or rehabilitated? 
 
	We live in 21th century where the criminal acts are increasing more and more these days. We live in society where the social norms are different for all people, it depends of people character which way of life to live to be good or to be bad. The kind of life some of the people live is really dangerous for other people, because they made such terrible acts that are not normal in any society it the whole world. The most important thing is that more and more people are included in the every day fights with crtiminals and they tried to diminished the criminal acts to minimum .
	Criminals should be imprisoned not rehabilitated because they made such terrible acts like murders, kidnapping, they stole things that are not in their own property they sell drugs they are capable to affect and to destroy people's lives. They are the bad guys in one society which is destroyed day by day by doing bad things. The criminals acts in the whole world are really huge and they are everywere. They must be imprisoned and they should be there because their acts must be punished really bad, because being rehabilitated is a gift for them is not a punishment, no matter of their mental health they must be punished. The best punishment for them is to be faced with all bad things they made to destroy people and the society in which we live, also they should be imprisoned and to have a chance to feel all the bad things on their own skin .
	To be rehabilitated means to help them to solve their mental problems and then to start doing bad things like before. There are small numbers of rehabilitated criminals that after they complete their medical tritments they stop doing the things they made before and they are transformed in completly new persons, that is not the case with most of them. Huge number of criminals in the world that are rehabilitated are making more terrible acts that are of big disadvantage for other people. They are capable of doing such terrible things that are distroying the lives of the normal people and change sometimes the norms of living in health and save society . 
	In conclusion, like I said it is really bad way of punishment to send some of the criminals to rehabilitation and to give them the opportunity to help them, without first to have the chance to face them with their acts. In some cases where the criminal acts are not so terrible the rehabilitation can help and can try to made good people of them, but in most cases the only punishment for such acts like murdering and selling drugs, kipnapping is facing them with the acts in the prison.

"The Tartan Museum
The modern, cheese-wedge buildings of Scotland's national museum contrast sharply with its historic Edinburgh location. But would its contents be as striking? Sally Varlow went to visit the museum just before it opened.
You cannot miss it. At first it was only the outside of the new Museum of Scotland that was unmissable, stuck on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its huge, yellow sandstone tower and cheese-wedge buildings, topped by a hulk of a hanging garden. Last winter the building was greeted with a mix of modernist architectural applause ('masterpiece', 'stunning'), cautious approval ('striking') and outright hostility. This winter, now that the inside is almost ready for the opening, the exhibitions themselves look set for a similar fate.
Forget the does-it-tell-a-nation's-story, is-it-chronological debate. The answers are definitely yes; it is a many-splendoured dream-coat of stories, each hung about a precious historic object, and there is an outline timescale that helps visitors get their bearings but does not strait-jacket the displays. And no, it does not let its lovely national treasures - such as Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the Holyrood chapel silver- get swamped in national pride.
The real issue here. assuming that the collections are properly preserved. is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to come back. Dr David Clarke. the head of exhibitions, insists that a visit should be a pleasurable. visual experience, and that it is designed not for specialists but for those with little prior knowledge. Despite this liberalism. Clarke is a convincing purist when it comes to what is on show. Mock-ups and scenes from the past that rely heavily on imagination are out. For Clarke. they are tantamount to 'giving a complete statement of certainty about what the past was like. which '. he explains, 'would be wrong. The public deserves the truth.' The result is that, at this museum. what you see is what the experts know. But the question for today's visitor is whether the objects' stories can be told vividly enough merely with explanation panels. captions and multi-media interpretation and using barely 30 computers in total around the museum.
Less than three days before the opening, it is still difficult to be sure. Some impressions are clear. though. and it is not just the panoramic views of Edinburgh Castle that take your breath away. Step inside and what immediately hits you is the sequence of spaces. Galleries open one into another. different sizes, different shapes. all with pale walls that are wood- panelled to look like large blocks of stone and inset with deep display cases. Shafts of daylight stream through arrow-slit windows and cascade down from the roof lights. There is room to ponder and enjoy every item on display.
Thanks to the 12-member Junior board. set up three years ago with 9- to l2-year-olds drawn from all over Scotland, the museum also has a Discovery Centre. What the group really wanted was to be able to ride through the displays. Dr Clarke admits. They lost that one, but won a dedicated children's hands-on centre in what should have been the temporary exhibition gallery. As a result. the Twentieth Century gallery, on the top floor. is the only temporary exhibition. Due to change after three years, it is a hotchpotch of objects chosen by Scottish people and other personalities as the items that have had most impact on life in Scotland in the twentieth century. The Prime Minister's suggestion was an electric guitar. Others went for televisions. Thermos flasks and favourite toys. Although the idea is fun. somehow it feels like a lightweight solution that has floated up to the top of the building. not a proper attempt to address serious issues. It may seem less frothy when the computerised bank of personal reasons and recollections goes live next week.

"Faced with John’s abandonment of the Charter, the rebels abandoned it too, and attempted a totally different solution.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

Although feminism has many forms and shapes, the main goal of it is to liberate women. Feminist movements started in the nineteenth century in the United States. However, the first feminists who joined the movement were treated more as individualists. Since then the strategies how to achieve and maintain equal rights in a masculine society have changed and developed. Most feminists are especially concerned with social, political and economic inequality between men and women. The majority of modern feminists believe that discrimination of women still exists wordwide. This essay is concerned with the the positive and negative causes of feminist movement. Since there are several points in favour to feminists, there are more things to be said to criticize modern feminism .
 The main advantage of the movement is that it has shown women's ability to fight for their rights in the society. First of all, women achieved the right to university education. After achieving this, they proved that women are better learners than men. The fact is that women now outnumber men in both high school graduation rates and university enrollment. Secondly, women are now free to participate in any sphere. This means that a woman can choose whether to sit at home with children or to run a bussiness, become a polititian and etc. If following, women are now free to initiate divorce proceedings. Feminist movements help women feel equal to men in the spheres of education, job and family .
 However, feminists are said to have done more harm to the cause of women. Firstly, after getting equal rights, women became in many ways similar to men. For example, it is now natural for women to demonstrate aggressiveness, dominance and even to dress like men. To continue, modern society puts a psychological pressure on every woman. This means that if a woman does not have a career, she might be treated as weak. Similarly, a woman who has a carrier cannot be equally devoted to her family.

Feminist movements started in the nineteenth century in the United States. However, the first feminists who joined the movement were treated more as individualists. Since then the strategies how to achieve and maintain equal rights in a masculine society have changed and developed. Most feminists are especially concerned with social, political and economic inequality between men and women. The majority of modern feminists believe that discrimination of women still exists wordwide. This essay is concerned with the the positive and negative causes of feminist movement. Since there are several points in favour to feminists, there are more things to be said to criticize modern feminism .\n The main advantage of the movement is that it has shown women's ability to fight for their rights in the society. First of all, women achieved the right to university education. After achieving this, they proved that women are better learners than men. The fact is that women now outnumber men in both high school graduation rates and university enrollment. Secondly, women are now free to participate in any sphere. This means that a woman can choose whether to sit at home with children or to run a bussiness, become a polititian and etc. If following, women are now free to initiate divorce proceedings. Feminist movements help women feel equal to men in the spheres of education, job and family .\n However, feminists are said to have done more harm to the cause of women. Firstly, after getting equal rights, women became in many ways similar to men. For example, it is now natural for women to demonstrate aggressiveness, dominance and even to dress like men. To continue, modern society puts a psychological pressure on every woman. This means that if a woman does not have a career, she might be treated as weak. Similarly, a woman who has a carrier cannot be equally devoted to her family. As a result, there are much more divorces than ever before. The growing numbers of children who rarely see their careerist mothers seem scary. What is more, there is a tension between men and women who want to dominate in the social sphere. Present situation shows that women compete among themselves more often than before. Moreover, men are now afraid of women's wish to become even more powerful in the society. By entering the social sphere, women not only become strong competitors but also act similarly to men .\n To sum up, feminism ideas can be viewed as positive for women because they encouraged them.

"Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is known as Mahatma meaning ‘Great Soul’. He was an astute political campaigner who fought for Indian independence from British rule and for the rights of the Indian poor.
His example of non-violent protest is still revered throughout the world today. Find out how this man of peace and representative of India's poor came from a privileged background and spent his teenage years as a rebel.
Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is born in north-west India in the princely state of Porbandar on 2 October 1869.
His family comes from an elite background. His father works for the government as the chief minister of Porbandar. His mother is a deeply pious woman who spends a lot of her time at temple and on frequent fasts. She instils in him a strong Hindu ethic, with an emphasis on vegetarianism, religious tolerance, a simple lifestyle, and non-violence.
Gandhi’s father moves the family to the nearby city of Rajkot. Crucially schooling here is better and Gandhi is taught English.
At the age of 13 Gandhi marries Kasturba, a local girl who is 14. Gandhi is a rebellious teenager – drinking, eating meat and womanising. Yet he is interested in self-improvement and is repentant after each act of vice. When his father is on his death bed, Gandhi leaves to have sex with his wife and misses the moment of his death. When his wife becomes pregnant and the child dies shortly after birth, he sees this as divine retribution.",B2,"{'title': 'text_201.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is known as Mahatma meaning ‘Great Soul’.

"It was a wonderful September day in Miami, Florida. On the wide white beach along the coast of Key Biscayne the sun was hot on the sand.
A slim young woman in her early twenties was lying alone down by the sea. She was beautiful, but her face was sad. Her long black hair fell over the book she was reading.

"Hide and Seek

Yvonne Coppard

Emma and her friends are pursuing a holiday game -- surveillance of a suspicious bookshop -- when she realises that one of its rare customers is her
Uncle Jim.
He callously draws her into a web of deceit and crime, manipulating her affection for him and attempting to alienate her from her friends, whose characters are persuasively drawn by Coppard.
When Emma finds her life in danger, things take a dark and compelling turn - her confinement in the cellar of a derelict house is stunningly handled.
This book reveals the minutiae of family life, the bonds of childhood friendship and warns that adults aren't always the protectors they ought to be. A vital and convincing read.

Backtrack

Peter Hunt

Two teenagers, 'peasant' Jack and Rill, a boarder at a posh girls school, join forces on realising that relatives of both were involved in an apparently inexplicable 1915 train accident, in which eight people died. Varied viewpoints and documents -- maps, first-hand accounts, hurt records, railway histories -- throw an ever-changing light on the incident, so that the reader works as hard as the two protagonists to understand what happened and why. A clever, complex novel which rewards close attention.

Pigeon Summer

Ann Turnbull

Mary Dyer doesn't really fit into her family or male-dominated culture; for one thing, she, a girl, loves her father's racing pigeons and when he must go away to find work, Mary knows enough to carry on managing the loft and winning prizes, despite increasing conflict with her harassed mother. Set believably in 1930, this readable tale has a sound basic message that 'There are different kinds of cleverness', which can't be bad. Thoughtful readers should find satisfaction here.

Yaxley's Cat

Robert Westall

Unusually, Robert Westall uses the viewpoint of a mature woman for this chilling story of rural prejudice and persecution. Rose, to escape from her materialistic life and her smug husband, rents Sepp Yaxley's cottage with her two children. A ferocious cat, and bizarre items found in cupboards, reveal the answer to why Yaxley disappeared, but the newcomers' presence arouses local hostility to the point where their own lives are at risk. By the end, the threatening violence is controlled, but Rose feels just as dismayed by the methodical ruthlessness of her teenage son. Utterly gripping.

Someone's Mother is Missing

Harry Mazer

At the poor, shambling, noisy end of the family there's Sam - fat, overtalkative and awed by his supercool and sophisticated cousin,
Lisa, from the apparently rich end of the clan. When Lisa's privileged world crumbles, it's Sam who helps her to find some balance, out of which both gain a better sense of reality and the value of family.
The pace is slightly slow in parts but there's a gentle humour and the developing closeness of the two teenagers is convincingly handled. It could be interesting to both boys and girls, which is a bit of a rarity.

Stanley's Aquarium

Barry Faville

Barry Faville writes with assurance and humour, vividly evoking his New Zealand setting and creating an intelligent and likeable first-person narrator. Robbie takes a jon gardening for elderly Stanley, finding him at first fascinating and later repellent; when she finds out what he keeps in his aquarium and what he plans to do with them, the book takes 'thrillerish' twist without losing its sharp insight into character and relationships. Unusual and compelling.

Dodger

Libby Gleeson

A painful, sad story where the troubled personal relationships plus the stormy school life of Mick are told though a skilful blend of flashback, a teacher's letters to a friend, the boys own notes and sympathetic narrative. Coming to terms with the negative expectations of others and his own poor sense of self-worth is achieved through a role in a school play and by an impressively sensitive first-year teacher.

"Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
Nowadays education is indispensable for people in order to find their place in the real world. But is university education, in particular, of great help to one in doing this ? To my mind, most people would answer negatively to this question. Very often one feels dejected on finding out that after they have studied hard for 5 years in a university, most of the extensive knowledge that they accumulated there will hardly ever be useful to them in the real world. The reason for this is the fact that university education is much more theoretical than practical which turns out to be a decided disadvantage. One must always bear in mind that what matters more is not how much one knows but how well they can use what they know. Thus, it is pointless just to sit down and acquire knowledge solely in order to pass one's exams when one may probably never use it afterwards .
However, most universities maintain the tradition and continue teaching theory as before .
Last year, for example, we had a course in computing which was, on the whole, completely useless. Instead of being taught how to use a computer and different kinds of software, most of our time was taken up by theoretical explanations of the way in which computers work. I do not mean that this information is absolutely unnecessary but my point is that it is good for nothing when you do not know how to use a computer in order to write and print out our essay, for instance .
On the other hand, it would not be really true to say that university degrees are wholly unrewarding. Theoretical education may be less valuable than practical for one's life in the real world but, nevertheless it is very important. The reason for this is that no matter how irrelevant or impracticable it may be, it still provides one with some general idea about things in life and thus may serve as a standard for comparison. Then, as one has already formed some model to refer to, it would be easier for them to decide what to do in a certain situation. Despite the difficulty of putting theory in practice, it is far easier to do than to start directly with the latter. So, after all, it is much better to have theoretical knowledge than not to have any at all .
Both teachers and students have been aware of this particular deficiency of university education and its respective influence in one's life, so attempts have been made to correct it. One possible way of doing this has been through introduction and development of various applied sciences in recent years, like applied mathematics, applied linguistic and others. These, however, are not very wide-spread and only a small number of universities have them as separate courses .
Another way of making university degrees more useful to students is to achieve a certain balance between the two sides of education. Moreover, one should be free to choose whether to concentrate on theory or practice with respect to their future plans and personal preferences. This is very important because different jobs require different types of knowledge and what would be valuable for one student, would be of no use to another .
To sum it up, I would say that one cannot so quickly write university degrees and education off. There are still valid although they do not give one full knowledge of the real world. If they are not as good as they could be, it is up to us to change them and to make them better .
Then one will feel more confident on leaving university that they are ready to cope with problems and difficulties in life .",C2,"{'title': '003_BGSU1022.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life.

"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees from the woods were turned into boards for construction work, there was an old brick building two floors high, and all around the outside walls were heaped great piles of soft sawdust. There were many of these golden mountains of dust covering that part of the yard right down to the blue lake. That afternoon, bored with having nothing else to do, all the fellows followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building and they sat with their legs hanging over the edge looking out across the lake. Suddenly Michael said, 'I dare you to jump down,' and without thinking about it, he pushed himself off the roof and fell on the sawdust where he lay rolling around and laughing. 'I dare you all!' he shouted. 'You're all cowards,' he said, encouraging them to follow him. Still laughing, he watched them looking down from the roof, white-faced and hesitant, and then one by one they jumped and got up grinning with relief. 
In the hot afternoon sunlight they all lay on the sawdust pile telling jokes till at last one of the fellows said, 'Come on up on the old roof again and jump down.'There wasn't much enthusiasm among them, but they all went up to the roof again and began to jump off in a determimed desperate way till only Michael was left and the others were all down below grinning up at him calling, 'Come on, Mike. What's the matter with you?' Michael wanted to jump down there and be with them, but he remained on the edge of the roof, wetting his lips, with a silly grin on his face, wondering why it had not seemed such a long drop the first time. For a while they thought he was only fooling them, but then they saw him clenching his fists tight. He was trying to count to ten and then jump, and when that failed, he tried to take a long breath and close his eyes. In a while the fellows began to laugh at him; they were tired of waiting and it was getting on to dinnertime. 'Come on, you're a coward, do you think we're going to sit here all night?' they began to shout, and when he did not move they began to get up and walk away, still shouting. 'Who did this in the first place? What's the matter with you all?' he called. 
But for a long time he remained on the edge of the roof, staring unhappily and steadily at the ground. He remained all alone for nearly an hour while the sun, like a great orange ball getting bigger and bigger, rolled slowly over the grey line beyond the lake. His clothes , were wet from nervous sweating. At last he closed his eyes, slipped off the roof, fell heavily on the pile of sawdust and lay there a long time. There were no sounds in the yard, the workmen had gone home. As he lay there he wondered why he had been unable to jump and then he got up slowly and walked home feeling deeply ashamed and wanting to avoid everybody. 
He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said to him coldly, 'You're big enough by this time surely to be able to get home in time for dinner. But if you won't come home, you’d better try staying in tonight.' She was a well-built woman with a fair, soft skin and a little touch of grey in her hair and an eternally patient smile on her face.

"Rock Band

Two years ago,our 14-year-old s on,Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first,we were very much against the idea because of the noise. 'It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time,' Ben argued ,'and it'll keep me out of trouble.' In the end we gave in. 'All right,' we said, 'but you must consider the rest of the family and the neighbours when you play.'
That was just the beginning. Because drums are not the easiest instrument to transport, the other members of Ben's band started appearing at our home with their guitars and other electrical equipment. And so, for several hours a week,the house shakes to the noise of their instruments and their teenage singing.
At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band start practising, my husband and I go out for a long walk. And I must admit that, although their music may sound a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill - after all I didn't expect my parents' generation to like the same music as I did when I was a teenage - but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people.
Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their school work because of their musical activities, though this hasn't happened yet. I am always stressing to Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is certain - Ben was right: it has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored.",B1,"{'title': '38.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Rock Band\n\nTwo years ago,our 14-year-old s on,Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday.

"Sea, Ice & Rock

Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also pioneered routes in Britain and the Alps and written many books, including Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) began his sea career in the Merchant Navy.
In 1968-9 he was the first to circumnavigate the world single-handed, in his yacht Sunhaili. He broke the transatlantic record, taking 10 days to reach the Lizard from New York. The two teamed up to sail and climb in Greenland, recording the trip in their new book: Sea, Ice and Rock.

In 1979 I was working on Quest for Adventure, a study of post-war adventure. I called Robin to ask for an interview and he said would I like to join him for a sail. I could show him some climbing techniques and he could show me the rudiments of sailing.
It was the first time I'd been on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat and we paddled to the shore to exercise Robin's skills at climbing.
The route was quite difficult and I was impressed at how steady Robin was in tricky conditions. He just padded quietly along. After a bit we I arrived at this huge drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn't, so I showed him. When I had finished, Robin very politely asked if he could go down the way he climbed down ropes on his boat.
He was used to using his arms, I wanted him to use his legs. I wasn't too happy about it, but he lowered himself down quite safely. It was during that trip to Skye that Robin and I built the foundation of a very real friendship.
His proposal that we should combine our skills on a joint trip to Greenland was just an extension, on a rather grand scale, of our voyage to Skye. Robin impressed me immensely as a leader. Traditionally, the skipper makes all the decisions.
But Robin made a point of consulting everyone first. Most of the time, nobody dared to advise him, but it was nice to feel you were part of the decision-making process.
To be frank, I found the sailing trying and very boring. The moments of crisis which we had on the way back were easy to deal with: the adrenaline pumps and you get all worked up. The bit I found difficult was spending day after day in the middle of the sea.
I am a land-lover and not really a do-it-yourself type of person. Robin, in contrast, is a natural sailor and seemed to enjoy tinkering with the engine or mending the lavatory. I was aware that Robin didn't really need me.
To be honest, I felt a bit useless at times; I found that very trying. The crew was also packed very close together: six people on a 32ft yacht, designed to sleep four. At least when you're on a mountain expedition you have a chance to get away from each other.
When we reached Greenland and it was my turn to 'lead' the expedition, I found it difficult taking responsibility for Robin's life. There were many instances climbing together when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me off with him. I had to watch for that constantly. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral -- Greenland's highest mountain - would be.
Robin isn't a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time we tried to reach the pinnacle, we were on the go for 24 hours. On the way down we were dropping asleep on 50 degree slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin went to hell and back, but he totally put his confidence in me.
He just followed. When it got too difficult and I realised wed have to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we'd be able to get it through the ice, whether it was in one piece.
Yet he was all in favour of us having another go at climbing the mountain. The only time there was a near-crisis in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking it in turns to be on watch. I was supposed to get up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He felt he could do it himself.
The previous night I'd almost dropped asleep. I felt that he didn't trust me - I felt insecure, and I said so. Robin immediately reassured me that I'd jumped to the wrong conclusion.
While we enjoyed the Skye trip, we didn't really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that underneath his bluff exterior, Robin was a kind-beaned, sensitive person.",C1,"{'title': '26.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Sea, Ice & Rock\n\nMountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is best known for scaling the summit of Everest in 1985.

"Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
	Every man is constantly shaped and influenced by his experiences. I find money the root of all evil for the following reasons: it makes people greedy, creates faulty values, and divides people according to social status.
	First of all, love of money is a recognized evil, that is born out of an excessive desire for it. There is a famous proverb that says ""Greed begets sin, sin begets death."" Furthermore, people in developed societies are in a vicious circle. They work hard so that they can earn more money. When they have more money, they spend more. The greed for money increases and they are never satisfied. And then, because they spend more, they have to work even harder. The circle goes round and round.
	Secondly, money caused a twisted turn in the real values of life since the times people started using gold and silver for trades. Health, family, friends and moral values were once a priority and not a concept. Marketing and advertising is overwhelming the population presenting idealistic images of high life styles and stressing the materialistic, hindering the spiritual. Therefore, people are subconsciously guided to worry more about the physical appearance of things. For example, with help of money, people undergo thousands of surgeries to gain a look appealing to the advertised standards of beauty. People find enjoyment in expensive comforts and have forgotten about feeding the spiritual, appreciating moments and people. The paradox is that they are losing their health, to pay for things and later on will be losing their money to pay for their health.
	Last but not least, there is the problem of dividing people according to social statuses. Society often judges people according to how much money they have, therefore money equals status. Rich and famous people receive better treatment in some institutions than poor. Usually, people of higher social status do not mingle with people of lower social status. People tend to look down on other who have less money than them. An example of this, could be the fact that in the past, marriages between two people of different social status were disapproved. Today, these marriages are always under the question of being out of interest. Moreover, money equals power. Many leaders of nations are completely disregarding the needs of the common people who support them. They manipulate and strive only towards accumulating their wealth.
	However, many may argue that money isn't the root of all evil. That excess of money could also be used for noble causes. Thus, Bill Gates donates millions of dollars through his foundation to help children in developing countries. These kind of people are guided by noble thoughts. People can argue that even without money, greed still exists and that crime is not triggered only by the possession or lack of money. For example, rape could be a result of lust, and murder a result of a quarrel. Moreover, some people think that money isn't the root of all evil, but rather the lack of money. Money is the result of hard-working process. Also, money motivates people to work smarter and harder. But then again, on the other hand, if there was no money, the lack of it, wouldn't adversely affect anyone. In my opinion, all the fears mentioned only exist because we need ' money ' to buy stuff. And if resources were distributed freely and equally, there would be no need for them.
	In conclusion, the question of money being a good or a bad thing, is debatable, but the fact stands that our world has become a dangerous place to live in, where decency, moral and freedom are just fading concepts that very few of us still remember. On a personal level, we ought to worry less about our image and bear in mind that too much power and wealth steals away piece of mind .

"REMOVAL DAY

With her children now grown, widowed Susan faces leaving the family home.

The van said, Susan noticed, ‘Removers of Distinction’, and indeed, every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed. Everything which made it particular was being wrapped in newspaper and packed in boxes by Fred the removal man, his enormous fingers like sausages tenderly handling all the breakables, and his team of helpers, not so gentle.
It was a lovely house that she was leaving, an elegant four-storeyed building overlooking a tiny harbour. The years she had spent there, the years of the children growing up and leaving, hung around in the air, faintly present like agitated dust. 
When told that they had bought this house, Robert, then five, had asked thoughtfully, ‘Mum, when you buy a house, how d’you get it home?’ You could miss a little boy in the physical presence of the adult he had become; Robert was here, helping, and in particular making sure she didn’t let on about the piano. Francesca was here too, also helping, in her bossy way, stubbornly certain that nobody but she, the family daughter, would be careful enough over a fine instrument like a Steinway piano.
‘She doesn’t look like she’s going to cry on us,’ observed Fred. ‘That’s something.’ ‘Do people cry?’ Susan asked, intrigued. ‘You'd be surprised,’ said Fred. ‘They go around merry as magpies helping out till its all in the van, then you look round and there they are, crying in the middle of an empty room. They're fine when we get to the new place, mind. It's just seeing everything taken apart that upsets them.’
She could easily imagine.
Left to herself, Susan would have warned the removers about the piano before accepting the estimate. Robert had said sternly that it was their business to see the problem, and their bad luck if they didn’t. The piano now stood in solitary glory in the upstairs sitting room, the best room in the house. They would leave it till last, naturally. Sitting on the bottom stair, for all the chairs were gone now, she remembered the time they had arrived.
The day she was living through now was like that day filmed and run backwards - the piano had been carried in first. And it had got stuck on the stairs. For nearly two hours the team of removal men struggled manfully with it, until it seemed they would simply have to give up.
They brought it up to the turn of the stairs, and down again, and cut out banister rails, and got it jammed anyway, while little Robert looked on enthralled, and young Francesca wailed, ‘We can’t live in a house without a piano! We can’t! I’d rather die!’ And of course they couldn’t, not with a musical daughter destined to be a concert pianist. They had to find a way to get it in, and a way had been found.
Peter, her late husband, had come home to the crisis and had resolved it. The piano had been left in the garden while the other furniture was brought in - there was much less of it then, they had been relatively young and hard up. And next day, to everyone’s surprise, a builder had been engaged to take out the first floor window.
Then, from the quay below the house, where fish were unloaded from the inshore boats, a little crane was borrowed, and dragged up the hill by means of the local farmer’s tractor. Finally, the piano was wrapped in blankets, hooked to the crane and gently swung safely through the gaping window, while the entranced children danced with joy at the sight of it.
However, the whole process had cost so much it was months before they could afford to have the piano professionally tuned. ‘That’s that,’ Peter had said. ‘That’s there for ever.’ But for ever is a long time.
The children were increasingly too busy to come home at weekends, and Susan was no longer so mobile in the house, and puffing as she climbed the stairs. The thought of the stairs interrupted her daydream. The banister rails were still not quite parallel, they had not been put back perfectly all that time ago. She ought to have warned the removers, surely she ought. But now it was too late. Any moment now they would find it. She looked around, dazed and panic-stricken.
‘Are you all right, love?’ Fred was saying. ‘Mind yourself, it’s just the piano to come now, and then we’ll be on our way.’ She moved from the bottom stair, heart beating. Robert and Francesca had both appeared, standing in the back of the hallway to watch. ‘No tears then?' Fred said, conversationally.
Truth to tell she was just on the edge of them. How odd that simply moving things made them matter. Chairs and cups and things, hundreds of things, that one never noticed or gave a moment’s thought to while they stayed put, now they were displaced, were full of pathos, crying out to be cared about - and she would have cried, in a moment, surely she would.
Only just then the piano appeared, lurching at the top of the stairs, with Fred backing down in front of it and one of the others behind. It tipped slightly. ‘Easy does it!’ cried Fred, and they carried smoothly down the stairs and out of the front door, and put it down behind the removal van on the road.
It was Robert who laughed first, but then they couldn't stop laughing, relieved that it was all over. All three of them, helplessly, leaning against each other, gasping for breath and laughing more. ‘What’s the joke, then?’ asked Fred, but he merely started them off again. So that, as they went, the three of them, arm in arm down the path for the last time, the only tears she shed were tears of laughter.",C2,"{'title': '5b124df6-0697-44d2-a17c-e78f4a386a4d.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""REMOVAL DAY\n\nWith her children now grown, widowed Susan faces leaving the family home.\n\nThe van said, Susan noticed, ‘Removers of Distinction’, and indeed, every distinguishing feature of the house was being removed.

The thought of the stairs interrupted her daydream. The banister rails were still not quite parallel, they had not been put back perfectly all that time ago. She ought to have warned the removers, surely she ought. But now it was too late. Any moment now they would find it. She looked around, dazed and panic-stricken.\n‘Are you all right, love?’ Fred was saying. ‘Mind yourself, it’s just the piano to come now, and then we’ll be on our way.’ She moved from the bottom stair, heart beating. Robert and Francesca had both appeared, standing in the back of the hallway to watch. ‘No tears then?' Fred said, conversationally.\nTruth to tell she was just on the edge of them. How odd that simply moving things made them matter. Chairs and cups and things, hundreds of things, that one never noticed or gave a moment’s thought to while they stayed put, now they were displaced, were full of pathos, crying out to be cared about - and she would have cried, in a moment, surely she would.\nOnly just then the piano appeared, lurching at the top of the stairs, with Fred backing down in front of it and one of the others behind. It tipped slightly. ‘Easy does it!’ cried Fred, and they carried smoothly down the stairs and out of the front door, and put it down behind the removal van on the road.\nIt was Robert who laughed first, but then they couldn't stop laughing, relieved that it was all over. All three of them, helplessly, leaning against each other, gasping for breath and laughing more. ‘What’s the joke, then?’ asked Fred, but he merely started them off again. So that, as they went, the three of them, arm in arm down the path for the last time, the only tears she shed were tears of laughter.""}"

"Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
The claim that there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination because our modern world is dominated by science, technology and industrialisation is, in my opinion, downright stupid. I also think that such a claim reveals a sense of nostalgia I think has little or no relevance to the genres, or professions if you like, which best express contemporary thought and ideas, namely literature, music and arts. In this essay I will try to elaborate on a few point in order to explain my view .
Frankly, I find the claim hard to grasp. Do humans dream less because of the invention of the microchip? Has our imagination diminished because we can now read books on the Internet? I think the claim could be narrowed down to ""evolution kills imagination"". Considering that humans still possess imagination, I feel tempted to point out the obvious: Human culture has evolved since the beginning. When did science and technology stop us from dreaming? Was it the invention of the lightbulb that killed our imagination? Rhetorical questions aside, here is my point: When one speaks of dreaming and imagination, then this nostalgia, this longing for the past, should be seen as much more dangerous than science and imagination. These are all traits that go hand in hand, and they are distinctly human. In fact, a modern world dominated by science and machines gives way to new dreams and new ways of thinking. Science fiction can be seen as an example of this, and so can electronic music. I have the feeling that someone capable of declaring that science and technology leaves no space for imagination, might not be the biggest Sci-fi nut .
Modern techniques such as photo rendering and computer graphics are new tools available to the modern artist. Sampling and the use of computers have become essentials in creating various forms of modern music, and writers of all kinds now use word processing. Modern technology can not only be a tool easing the creative prosess, it can also make new forms of creativity possible. Some critics argue that the use of modern tools such as computers often results in inferior quality. To that I can only say that the artist has the sole responsibility. It should be fairly obvious that the choice of tools directly influences the creative process. Some even argue that musicians should not need to go to school to develop a high level of proficiency on their instruments. They fear that schooling takes away the individual character of an up-and-coming musician. In response to such fears I quote the renowned guitarist Bill Frisell: ""It's only the players' fault if they let themselves be programmed by the routines that these places establish."" He continues: ""For example, in the harmony classes at Berklee, they'd have ' avoid notes', notes you weren't supposed to use over a particular chord. Naturally, those were the first ones I'd check out."" (Guitar Player, July 1992) I think the combined output of all contemporary artistic activity is a clear indicator of the state of mankind. Many argue that this is precisely the job of an artist; to mirror contemporary ideas and thoughts in all its shapes .
Industrialisation and new technology inevitably shapes our daily life and the world around us, hence it also influences the way we think and the way we dream. Invention and progress should be seen as assets, not burdens, of living in modern times. I think a key point in this discussion is whether the comforts of modern life, with all its impressive gadgets and its focus on effectiveness, leaves us with more spare time to dream or not. I believe that is often the case, and if not, one should reconsider the ways in which the fruits of modern times are employed. The responsibility of an action is that of the performer, not the tool.

"Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 
 
Our world is dominated by technology. Not a day passes without us being reminded of this fact by what we see or use .
The fact that science, technology and industrialization are so dominating in our society is a threat to our future happiness. The dominance makes us feel safe, since it is we ourselves who have created it. This feeling of security is false. Progress does not only bring good fortune, however we, with our blind faith in the future, seem to be wearing blinkers .
For instance, industrialization does not always bring progress of a positive nature. Think of the workers who are being made redundant as a result of it. Having to work under the threat of being made redundant is not living a life at ease. Consequently the employees perform badly due to their uneasy existence. Thanks to science and research new projects are being launched everyday. Projects which lead to several new places of employment in the end .
You see, we are all puppets in a theatre, and whoever pulls our strings does so without thought to our mental keep. Driving to work, working in the treadmill, keeping quiet and doing as we are told, that is how we live our lives .
The scientists come up with extraordinary, new findings. However, the truth of the matter is that it is no longer a question of developping new machines for our needs, but of developping new human needs for the machines. Of course, technology has given us a lot for which we are thankful, e g air-conditioning, and other things which we do not find that necessary, e g the egg-boiler .
In the hectic society of today the room for imagination is not as large as perhaps it used to be. People can not survive without any recreation or amusement and consequently find different ways to cope. There are, I find, three different categories, as follows: 	Firstly and largest is the category of people who have to look for ways of expressing their imagination in their spare time, since their trade gives no oppurtunity during working-hours. Therefore, even if they go at it from dawn to dusk, they always find themselves some diversion in leisure hours. The negative aspect of this is that due to the shortage of spare time, some of the diversions found are not good for them, i e alcohol, drugs. To take care of these poor creatures a whole industry is created in the form of health centres and spas. At these centres the ""guests"" are encouraged to give a free rein to their imaginations and get to know themselves in order to submit to their fates .
Secondly, there is the category of people who need imagination to be able to perform their work, e g designers, architects, artists. Those who have creative jobs have the advantage of being able to unfold their dreams during working-hours. Consequently they do not have any imagination left when they come home after a hard days work. They get bored easily and look for diversions, which they easily find at each other's cocktail-parties. And the result of too frequent partying is a visit to a spa .
Thirdly and finally, there is the category of people who have a balanced degree of imagination divided evenly between working-hours and spare time. This is where the majority of us belongs. The people who keep the society going, pay our taxes and take care of our fellowmen of the other two categories .
To conclude, there are pros and cons with the dominance by technology as it is with so many things. I am certain we do not want to be without it. Imagination will always have its natural place in our modern world. It is only through our imagination that technology and science will find further progress .",B2,"{'title': '452_SWUL4001.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination.

"Running a business in the countryside 

Five women talk about their experiences setting up a business in the countryside. 

A.
'My customers are friends,' says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who runs a computer-aided design business with a turnover of over PS200,000 a year and four full-time employees. 'My husband and I moved out of London to the country when our children were small, and I wanted work I could do at home. I had worked with computers before I was married, so my husband suggested I set up a computer-aided design business. It needed a huge amount of money and things were difficult in the beginning. But I have been very careful, making sure that I told the bank manager if I was likely to overspend. Being in the house is a big saving, and I can carry on working in the evening if I want. It has remained a small business. We hardly ever deliver work - people from the area tend to collect it from us.' 

B.
'I enjoy being independent,' says MAGGY SASANOW, who works from home as a designer of greetings cards. 'I trained in art at university, and wanted to work in a museum. But when I married, we went to live in the countryside, where there wasn't that sort of work. So I decided to set up my own business and I produce a range of 50 greetings cards which I sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The disadvantage of working from home is that there is always something that needs doing - like mowing the lawn. My business comes completely by word of mouth - I don't advertise at all. People send work down from London as I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone, I don't get to exchange ideas with other people any more, but generally there are more advantages than disadvantages.' 

C.
'It has been hard at times,' says DELIA TURNER, whose curtain-making business has seen good times and bad. 'I started my business eight years ago. Then this type of business was expanding, and in two years my turnover went from PS24,000 to PS80,000. I used to manage six full-time curtain-makers. But I had to sack them because of the decline in the economy, which was painful because it is not easy to find other jobs in this area. I am right back almost to where I started, making the curtains at home myself, with my husband's help, and using women who work from their homes. I have to be prepared to cut my prices when it's necessary and to look at different opportunities.' 

D.
TESSA STRICKLAND runs the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. 'I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. The first was financial, because London was so expensive, and the second was because I love the country. I enjoy being able to work when I want to. Eighty per cent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East and North America, so I have to take calls at odd hours. The disadvantage is that it requires discipline to shut the office door. I publish children's books from cultures around the world, working with authors and artists. All my professional experience had been in London, so I used to feel very alone at first.' 

E.
MEG RIVERS runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a turnover of PS250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. 'I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I started making fruit cakes, using good quality flour and eggs.

'My husband and I moved out of London to the country when our children were small, and I wanted work I could do at home. I had worked with computers before I was married, so my husband suggested I set up a computer-aided design business. It needed a huge amount of money and things were difficult in the beginning. But I have been very careful, making sure that I told the bank manager if I was likely to overspend. Being in the house is a big saving, and I can carry on working in the evening if I want. It has remained a small business. We hardly ever deliver work - people from the area tend to collect it from us.' \n\nB.\n'I enjoy being independent,' says MAGGY SASANOW, who works from home as a designer of greetings cards. 'I trained in art at university, and wanted to work in a museum. But when I married, we went to live in the countryside, where there wasn't that sort of work. So I decided to set up my own business and I produce a range of 50 greetings cards which I sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The disadvantage of working from home is that there is always something that needs doing - like mowing the lawn. My business comes completely by word of mouth - I don't advertise at all. People send work down from London as I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone, I don't get to exchange ideas with other people any more, but generally there are more advantages than disadvantages.' \n\nC.\n'It has been hard at times,' says DELIA TURNER, whose curtain-making business has seen good times and bad. 'I started my business eight years ago. Then this type of business was expanding, and in two years my turnover went from PS24,000 to PS80,000. I used to manage six full-time curtain-makers. But I had to sack them because of the decline in the economy, which was painful because it is not easy to find other jobs in this area. I am right back almost to where I started, making the curtains at home myself, with my husband's help, and using women who work from their homes. I have to be prepared to cut my prices when it's necessary and to look at different opportunities.' \n\nD.\nTESSA STRICKLAND runs the editorial and production side of her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. 'I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. The first was financial, because London was so expensive, and the second was because I love the country. I enjoy being able to work when I want to. Eighty per cent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East and North America, so I have to take calls at odd hours. The disadvantage is that it requires discipline to shut the office door. I publish children's books from cultures around the world, working with authors and artists. All my professional experience had been in London, so I used to feel very alone at first.' \n\nE.\nMEG RIVERS runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop with a turnover of PS250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. 'I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I started making fruit cakes, using good quality flour and eggs. Then I started getting requests from friends and relatives, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago I rented a small building and everything is made there - we have a baker and assistant, and a professional cake-icer. I don't cook at all now, as I run the commercial side.

"Title: Death Penalty 
 
We still have death penalty in Japan. I don't think no one in the world have a right to decide to kill anyone. I'm against the idea of death penalty .
I watched a TV program reporting death penalty in the world. There are quite a few countries where they still have death penalty. I wonder why people can decide to kill any other people. It's just like a war. The scenes on the TV report were very miserable and I'd like to write my opinion against death penalty in this essay .
First reason against the death penalty is that usually in the countries where they still have death penalty, the justice system is not arranged correctly. The government in those countries usually has a leader like Hitler. The people in the high position in those countries can decide whether the person in judge should reserve death penalty or not. Because of the poor govermental system, we can say they still have death penalty .
Secondly, death penalty does not lesson the number of crimes in that country. One of the purpose of death penalty is to show other people that if you do something wrong and something against the government, you'll be killed. Is there any country where they have less crimes because of having death penalty? I don't think so. Death penalty only give fear to people in the country. There is no effect of lesson the number of crimes .
Thirdly, how can you give death to a person who had crime? Do you think you can kill the person by your hand? In some countries, electric chair is used. However, there is no difference. Think that you push the button of the chair. How can you do that? What would you think if the judge was not right. Can you make the dead alive? Never. Thus, I think putting in jail for life is much better than death penalty .
Fourthly, the criminal may have a chance to follow a normal life. If he had a chance to think, to apologize, to plan ahead, he may be able to go back to the society later. Can we take his change away? In case of homicides, of course we can understand how the family of the killed feel. They are eager to kill the criminal, I'm sure. Still some of the family members sometimes want the criminals come back to the society so that they can work for the other people. That actually happens. The TV program showed how a person who was supposed to sentenced to death relived from it and have a social life. He worked hard in jail and apologized to the family of the killed and the family forge him. Thus, there is a way for the criminal to come back to the society. If you think people's life important, then you need to forgive the criminals, too .
Lastly, I think we are all humans. I wonder how we can decide to kill some one on the earth. We don't have the right to do so. Of course the same thing can be said from the family of the killed. We need to ask them to be patient and kind. By forgiving even the criminals, we can really live together on the mother earth .",B1,"{'title': '266_JPTM1024.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: Death Penalty \n \nWe still have death penalty in Japan.

"Week after week, British tabloid newspapers carry pictures which intrude into people’s privacy and break the newspaper editors’ code of practice. Although pop stars do pose for paparazzi on occasion, this is not typical. More usually, great damage is done to [line 6: beginning] individuals in the public eye when they see their most [line 6: end] private moments captured on the front page. Yet very few call on the services of the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), an organisation that was set up to deal with issues of this kind. 
Rarely, if ever, are these pictures in the public interest. Do intimate shots of pop stars help to detect a crime? In what way did the picture of a famous actress on a hotel bedroom balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has made a fuss about long-lens pictures in the past and since she was in a hotel, a place where, to quote the code of practice, ‘there is a reasonable expectation of privacy’, she had good cause for complaint, but she didn’t take any action. 
That the PCC did not launch an investigation itself is a scandal. It should also be looking into the outrageous story published recently about a pop star’s love life. The pop star, like the famous actress, has held back from making a formal complaint. Shouldn’t the PCC [line 25: beginning] take the initiative on this and other shameful attacks? [line 25: end]
To begin with, this seems like a great idea. It would surely lead to many decisions against newspapers. These would be reported by their rivals and broadcast on TV and radio. The public would not be sympathetic and editors would have to refuse to publish such material. Even photographers would be affected, no longer finding it financially possible to spend their days hidden behind trees waiting to snap unsuspecting celebrities. 
If the PCC decided to take on this role of ‘police officer’, which it technically could, there would be several problems. How would it decide whether or not to launch an inquiry? Should it approach the victim and encourage him or her to make a complaint? And if the person involved still refused to do anything, should it proceed nevertheless? In addition, celebrities and members of royalty might well expect that any story involving them would be taken up, and then be outraged to find it wasn’t. Above all, the role itself is too enormous. How could the PCC realistically monitor the whole of the British press: national, regional and magazines? 
Then there is the embarrassment factor to consider. However seriously someone’s privacy has been invaded, would they really want the further embarrassment of an investigation? I suspect the majority simply want to put it behind them and get on with their lives. Of course, one or two may have other reasons for keeping quiet. A worse story may exist, that they have managed to keep from the press, and they realise that this may also become public knowledge if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become the enemy. 
One British comedian also suffered at the hands of the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He didn’t complain then, nor more recently, when he and his family were again victims of a sneak photographer during a family holiday. His reason for this was fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would re-run the pictures with a new story about his ‘fury’, saying that they thought it was just a bit of fun, and that, being a film star who made comedies, they thought he had a sense of humour.

"There are plans afoot to change the laws on treason in the UK, with a commission on citizenship led by Lord Goldsmith recommending reform, but what is the law ?
There is an awful lot of statute law in the UK that deals with treason.
But the most important part was first passed in England in 1351. And it is perhaps one of the few pieces of 14th Century legislation to be regularly discussed in the 21st Century.
What the law actually said was in Norman French, but put succinctly in English, you can't kill, conspire against or wage war against the king and his family. You also can't have sex with his wife, heir's wife or his unmarried eldest daughter. And the act goes on to rule out actions against the chancellor, treasurer and various categories of senior judge.
Treason existed before the 1351 act, but this was the first attempt to set parameters for it, says legal historian Prof Michael Lobban, of Queen Mary, University of London.
""We did have treason before but it wasn't very well defined. There was concern that the crown could manipulate a trial. They wanted to give a precise definition to it.""

'Coffee?' she asked.\n'Yes, please,' he said. 'I'm sorry about yesterday. I only wanted to help. I'm better with volcanoes than I am with business people.'\n'I know you wanted to help.' Rachel put the coffee back on the warmer, turned and said: 'Do you want to come to dinner tonight? I want to say thank you.'\n'Thank you? What for?'\n'You stopped Graham jumping into that water.'\n'OK. Yes, please. I do want to have dinner with you.'\nLater in the morning, Harry and Terry went out in the helicopter.

Hi Anna,
I'm not having a very good week!
Yesterday my team had a volleyball match, but we lost. The other team played much better than we did! Then my friend Jeff, who lives in Australia, telephoned with bad news. He can't come to stay with us during the holidays because he's got a summer job. We can't go camping together now. And this morning, my sister got up late so she rode my bike to school! She didn't tell me she needed to use it. I'm really angry with her. 
I hope you have some good news! Write back today if you can.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
A definition of feminism stated in dictionaries is usually very simple and sounds very innocent: the principle that women should have the same rights and chances as men. This principle must be definitely considered as justified and rightful. Nevertheless not many people (especially not men) imagine exactly the above termed principle under the word ""feminism"". The bulk of the worldwide population would defined it rather as ""some sort of furious activities practised by over-ambitious females"". They imagine angry, rattled women marching through the streets, yelling ""We do hate men!"" the question is if such an opinion can be or should be contradicted and accused as wrong misleading or simplified .
All the main slogans proclaimed by feminism, i.e. radical feminism, because only this branch of the movement expresses itself aloud enough, those main slogans advise women not to get ""enslaved"" by marriage"", not to become ""factories for producing children"", not to let men use them as toys to play with... Such ideas might be not only unpleasant for both men and reasonable women but they might be also extramely dangerous for the growing up generation .
Girls are as intelligent as boys but we cannot ignore the fact that the two sexes have different inborn qualities. It is a fact! Boys are rather rational, girls more emotional, boys are usually more ambitious or wilder than girls, who are very often placid and modest as far as their career is concerned. Everybody would agree that both girls and boys - or men and women, if you want - should have the same right and opportunity in employment and education but at the same time even the radical feminists must see that there is a certain number of girls who will be perfectly satisfied as housewives or taking only part-time jobs which will leave them enough time to look after their families, their husbands and children. And thereis no reason to blame the girls for following this traditional female role-model, no reason to call them ""slaves"" and to prevent them from their choice. Of course, not all young women will be satisfied with this social role. Despite of that they will be able to divide their interests between their professional and family life in most cases without any problem. There is something unnatural in the feminists'vision of a ""househusband"" or a highly career orientated woman .
Feminists advise not to have children. Why? Don't the feminists see what power it is hidden in the ability of giving birth to a child? Females are not ""factories for producing children"", their bodies are ingenious, strong as also many male gynecologists state, they are able of something very special and inimitable. Why should women get rid of such an honourable status?
Are women just men's toys? Another nonsense. Every real man, even the toughest one, becomes soft as wax when dealing with a charming, i.e. real woman. Men would never admit it and feminists don't want to see it but it is a lady who governs her cavalier'life. And her power is in concealing the fact and being aware of this fact at the same time .
Feminists and their generally known activities seem not to fight women's discrimination to win equality for women against men, more likely they strive to be like men. Women should stay women.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
Three years of one's life is spent reading reading and reading, if one is at a university. Where is the fun in it if all you do is read and don't get practical?
Other people may say that it is precise. True. But the only time you get to experience what you have been reading about is only when you have completed your studies, and some degrees take four years to complete even five if necessary. An example would be the LLB degree. It has a four-year curriculum and a five-year curriculum, and do believe me when I say after you complete your degree, you still have to go to a law school in order to be considered ""qualified"". But that does not guarantee you a job, you still have to hunt it down. How are companies going to recognise your capability if they do not know about you? That is what I think practically tries to emphasise, ""your capability"".
I consider university theory sacrete. I mean, whether you pass with distinctions and understand your studies very well, who knows about it hah? Only when you have completed your degree may you be considered to be ""semi-qualified"". Why ""Semi""? Because experience plays a major role in one's ability to get a job. So if you don't have experience, people might as well refer to you as an ""amateur"". One would just crack thinking of the hell one went through, all those sleepless nights, trying to get it right .
Another thing about universities is that the cost a fortune! Some may say it is a challenge that one faces to study hard and get distinctions so that one can receive a bursary. Also true. But what happens then to a B-aggregate student hah?! The only way one can get a bursary is when one gets more than three distinctions. And what do we call this ""psychologically""? We call it pressure!
Just because some students manage getting more than three distinctions does not mean ""One can, all can"" As individuals, we are all different. That is why we are reffered to as individuals. We all have our ways of doing, observing and understanding things and those ways aren't all the same. That is why we also have another concept called ""perspective"" which is defined as one's mental window through which one looks at reality. That's also why our population groups are divided into two groups, the other being rich ant the other being poor. This shows that not everyone does the same things, have the same things and has the same things .
In conclusion I want to say, students should be given an opportunity to explore you know, get practical. This will serve as another way of making it in life for students, especially those who cannot afford tuition fees. At least being practical and studying has a point. This point being that one gets more educated and becomes more better at what one does. Eventually all this leads to every worker's favourite word, ""a raise"".

Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases
A
Abyss
Long before Titanic, director James Cameron made this sweaty, claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water The banter and self-deprecating bravery of foreman Bud and his men rekindle memories of similarly laconic heroes In movies directed by Howard Hawks. Production design and special effects are hugely impressive. It's only the dialogue and characterisation that creak For all the craftsmanship which goes Into the film-making, the story Itself IS strictly B-movie material.
B
The Thin Red Line
The video release of this version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal directed by Andrew Marton makes a fascinating counterpart to Terrence Malick's new film. Whereas Malick's approach IS mystical and poetic, Marton made a much more conventional war movie. albeit one that is often truer to the book. He concentrated on a single soldier, and on his relationship with his abrasive sergeant. Malick's film IS Infinitely richer and more complex, but Marton's version has ItS moments. The flashback sequence, In which the soldier dreams of the wife he longs for, is handled with a harshness which arguably works better than Malick's soft-focus Imagery of the woman on the swing.
C
On Guard
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this corny but highly watchable swashbuckler IS a cut above most musketeer adventures It has a consummate villain In Fabrice Luchini's clammy politician, orchestrating death and destruction behind the scenes Vincent Perez makes an exuberant (If rather short-lived) hero, and while Daniel Auteuil is perhaps too moody a presence for a romp like this, he too has his moments as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The film-makers peddle costume-drama cliches with so much Wit and sparkle It never seems to matter.
D
Character
A handsome but dour tale, set In turn-of-the-century Rotterdam. The excessively detailed production and costume design leave the film looking like a museum piece. Taking his cue from the surroundings, Jan Decleir is endlessly morose as the brutal bailiff Dreverhaven, who behaves ruthlessly when evICting tenants. HIS antagonistic relationship with his son IS at the core of the story, but the film-makers seem too busy laYing on the period detail to do Justice to the dark and vicious parable.
E
The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
This digitally re-mastered video re-release shows off director Leone's craftsmanship to ItS best advantage. The sound editing, in particular, stands out every footstep, creaking floorboard or barking dog registers loud and clear. The storytelling IS relentlessly cruel and whenever there's a lull, It only takes a burst of Morricone's magnificent music to quicken the pulse On a moral level, there Isn't much to distinguish between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef) and the ugly (Ell Wallach), all of whom seem equally unscrupulous as they maraud across the post- Civil War West.
F
The Longest Day
'Forty-eight International stars' trumpets the publicity for this three-hour Darryl Zanuck war epic. With four directors and 23,000 extras as well, this is one pudding which is definitely over-egged The early sequences, in which the battle-hardened veterans walt for confirmation of when the invasion will happen, drag as much for the audience as for the soldiers. On a logistical level (If not an aesthetic one), this is an impressive enough feat but it cries out for the big screen Panned and scanned on video, It is inevitably a diminished experience.",C1,"{'title': 'ab7b1717-5bdb-45c3-bc09-1980e57ab182.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Films on video\nFilm critic Nick James reviews some recent releases\nA\nAbyss\nLong before Titanic, director James Cameron made this sweaty, claustrophobic Cold War thriller about oil riggers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine stranded many miles beneath water The banter and self-deprecating bravery of foreman Bud and his men rekindle memories of similarly laconic heroes In movies directed by Howard Hawks.

"Maria Mutola

In 1988, Maria Mutola was playing football as the only girl in an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. 'We won,' she said. 'At first no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.'
The story appeared in a local newspaper and Jose Craveirinha, who had encouraged other African athletes, learnt about Maria. He went to meet her and found her kicking a ball around outside the football club. He realised immediately that she was fast. 'He talked to me about athletics. I had no idea what he meant. The only sport I knew about was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me training. It was such hard work and my legs really ached.' But Jose visited her parents and persuaded them she could be successful and this would help end their poverty. They agreed to let him take her away to train.
In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had refused previously because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was unlike those of the girls she met in the US. She explains, 'They were good athletes but, while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were brilliant and I learnt a lot.'

"Who were you talking to?' asked Ruth, coming into the sitting room now the children were asleep at last. 'Stephany,' said Carlo.
'Why does Stephany want our flat for her holiday? Why can't she find her own hotel or something?' Ruth asked.
'You know I promised Stephany she could use the flat. It was before I knew you. I can't suddenly change my mind, just because we're married.'
'I just think giving someone my home is unnecessary'
'But the flat isn't your home,' said Carlo. 'You didn't want to live in the flat, remember? You didn't like living in the village. You wanted a bigger house. This house is your home, not the flat. The flat is empty and it is much better if someone uses it.'

"We changed lives for a day!

Have you ever dreamed about swapping lives with someone else for a day? Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change? We fixed it for four people - read how it went.
Amanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress at a glitzy London restaurant and entertainment complex.

A. Amanda’s story

I’d never been inside anywhere remotely like it before. I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was - there were so many people and such a brilliant atmosphere. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I’d survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else!
I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes a fool of themselves at first!
By opening time at 11.30 am, a queue had already formed outside and I began to feel really nervous. I was worried about how I’d remember all the orders, but that, at least, wasn't a problem because everything was automated.
After a couple of hours my feet really ached and I couldn't get used to the constant loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me I had to say ‘Pardon?’, which was so embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was totally exhausted and longed to soak my feet in a bowl of hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a ‘quiet' day!
I never realised how tiring waitressing would be. I've always thought it was a job for shrinking violets, but in fact you definitely need to be quite bubbly, as well having the ability to keep a cool head and deal with what is known in the trade as a ‘high-volume experience' - in other words, lots of customers!
I’m really quite shy and I don't think I could cope on a Saturday night, when it gets chaotically busy. I wasn’t too impressed with the pay either. Unfortunately, I must have been a lousy waitress because even the rich Americans didn’t tip me a bean!
I must admit I was very glad to get back to my children. It seems quite easy after waitressing!

B. Cindy’s story

I was feeling quite apprehensive about being a ‘mum’ for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. I’d been warned the girls were cheeky, but in my ignorance I thought I could handle it. Little did I know!
As Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery I thought I’d have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house and do the washing.
At 1 pm I picked up Katie, whizzed around the supermarket and then took her home for lunch. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could! I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they’d soon get worn out. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down!
After much persuasion, I managed to get them into bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun and games started! How many glasses of water can a child drink, for heaven's sake? Of course, I realised it was just a ploy so they could come downstairs and watch television, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating deals with them.
I never realised how tiring it could be looking after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself - and the sheer sense of responsibility is overwhelming. Even so, I really enjoyed the day.

Rosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school.

C. Rosemary’s story

On the farm, I have to get up at 5.30 am so sleeping in until 7 was pure luxury! But I dithered for ages about how to look. I could hardly turn up in overalls and boots, could I?
Looking at a sea of faces — about 400 pupils — at assembly, I hoped I melted into the background and that my fresh complexion didn't make me stand out as being straight off the farm.
After that it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded according to difficulty - rather different from when I was at school and we had to recite tables in unison! Then I helped out with a nature project - identifying and feeding species of snails.
By lunchtime I was exhausted and looking forward to an hour's break, but the teachers only have about five minutes to eat their meal. There’s so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid getting roped in to help with athletics trials.
Alter lunch there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was great fun because all the children wanted to practise on me, which really showed up my rusty French.
Finally we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have inexhaustible energy.
The hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking - even for just two minutes, it's daunting. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I’ll stick to farming, anyway!

D. Hilary’s story

I arrived at White House Farm at 8.30 am, bright and early, only to discover that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves and heifers and about 800 ewes! As well as milk, she manufactures ice-cream, yoghurt and cream, which is sold in shops, restaurants and at tourist attractions. I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk into plastic litre containers, squeezing ice-cream from a machine into cartons and sticking on labels. It was difficult to stop myself dipping my fingers into the goodies! At lunchtime it was time to inspect the sheep. I drove over to one of the fields and picked up a ewe which had fallen over. If the sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they have fallen over they could die, so they have to he checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter!
Alter feeding the calves, I started the milking. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year!
I found it quite a lonely day. I was surprised how much I missed the children - animals don't answer back! The worst aspect of the job is not being able to get away from work.

Perhaps you think it would be more fun to do something quite different for a change? We fixed it for four people - read how it went.\nAmanda (23), a young mother with two daughters, swapped lives with her friend Cindy (30), who works as a waitress at a glitzy London restaurant and entertainment complex.\n\nA. Amanda’s story\n\nI’d never been inside anywhere remotely like it before. I couldn't believe how dark and noisy it was - there were so many people and such a brilliant atmosphere. It was all a far cry from my home town and, to he honest, I wasn't sure I’d survive! Being a mother is definitely a busy job - but this was something else!\nI had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks at shoulder height with one hand. The other waitresses made it look so simple, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and crashed on to the floor, splattering cocktails everywhere. I was so embarrassed, but all the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes a fool of themselves at first!\nBy opening time at 11.30 am, a queue had already formed outside and I began to feel really nervous. I was worried about how I’d remember all the orders, but that, at least, wasn't a problem because everything was automated.\nAfter a couple of hours my feet really ached and I couldn't get used to the constant loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me I had to say ‘Pardon?’, which was so embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was totally exhausted and longed to soak my feet in a bowl of hot water. I couldn't believe it when one of the waitresses told me it had been a ‘quiet' day!\nI never realised how tiring waitressing would be. I've always thought it was a job for shrinking violets, but in fact you definitely need to be quite bubbly, as well having the ability to keep a cool head and deal with what is known in the trade as a ‘high-volume experience' - in other words, lots of customers!\nI’m really quite shy and I don't think I could cope on a Saturday night, when it gets chaotically busy. I wasn’t too impressed with the pay either. Unfortunately, I must have been a lousy waitress because even the rich Americans didn’t tip me a bean!\nI must admit I was very glad to get back to my children. It seems quite easy after waitressing!\n\nB. Cindy’s story\n\nI was feeling quite apprehensive about being a ‘mum’ for the day, but I was looking forward to it, too. I’d been warned the girls were cheeky, but in my ignorance I thought I could handle it. Little did I know!\nAs Amanda left to make her way to the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery I thought I’d have three hours of peace. Wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house and do the washing.\nAt 1 pm I picked up Katie, whizzed around the supermarket and then took her home for lunch. But it was when I brought Sophie home from school that the real trouble started. They turned the settee into a trampoline and played a game which involved screaming as loudly as they possibly could! I decided to take the laid-back approach, imagining they’d soon get worn out. Wrong again. I thought I had a fair amount of stamina, but they beat me, hands down!\nAfter much persuasion, I managed to get them into bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun and games started! How many glasses of water can a child drink, for heaven's sake? Of course, I realised it was just a ploy so they could come downstairs and watch television, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating deals with them.\nI never realised how tiring it could be looking after two small children. You don't get a second to think about yourself - and the sheer sense of responsibility is overwhelming. Even so, I really enjoyed the day.\n\nRosemary (42) runs a dairy farm. She swapped with Hilary (30), a teacher at a primary school.\n\nC. Rosemary’s story\n\nOn the farm, I have to get up at 5.30 am so sleeping in until 7 was pure luxury! But I dithered for ages about how to look. I could hardly turn up in overalls and boots, could I?\nLooking at a sea of faces — about 400 pupils — at assembly, I hoped I melted into the background and that my fresh complexion didn't make me stand out as being straight off the farm.\nAfter that it was time for a maths class. The children worked in small groups, using workcards graded according to difficulty - rather different from when I was at school and we had to recite tables in unison! Then I helped out with a nature project - identifying and feeding species of snails.\nBy lunchtime I was exhausted and looking forward to an hour's break, but the teachers only have about five minutes to eat their meal. There’s so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and couldn't avoid getting roped in to help with athletics trials.\nAlter lunch there was a silent reading lesson (bliss!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was great fun because all the children wanted to practise on me, which really showed up my rusty French.\nFinally we moved on to the school hall for Physical Education. I was drained by now, but the children seemed to have inexhaustible energy.\nThe hardest part of the job was standing up in front of the class and speaking - even for just two minutes, it's daunting. Teachers may get more holidays a year, but I think I’ll stick to farming, anyway!\n\nD. Hilary’s story\n\nI arrived at White House Farm at 8.30 am, bright and early, only to discover that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's 280-acre farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves and heifers and about 800 ewes! As well as milk, she manufactures ice-cream, yoghurt and cream, which is sold in shops, restaurants and at tourist attractions. I spent most of the morning in the ice-cream parlour, bottling milk into plastic litre containers, squeezing ice-cream from a machine into cartons and sticking on labels. It was difficult to stop myself dipping my fingers into the goodies! At lunchtime it was time to inspect the sheep. I drove over to one of the fields and picked up a ewe which had fallen over. If the sheep are left for more than 12 hours once they have fallen over they could die, so they have to he checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter!\nAlter feeding the calves, I started the milking. The process took an exhausting two-and-a-half hours. And Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, seven days a week, 365 days a year!\nI found it quite a lonely day. I was surprised how much I missed the children - animals don't answer back! The worst aspect of the job is not being able to get away from work. The cows always have to be milked twice a day, so it's really difficult to plan any time off. Rosemary will only get about three days' holiday this year.\nFarming seems romantic but the reality is very different. The income is irregular and I'd hate to be at the mercy of the weather.""}"

"Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
For many years, capital punishment has been discussed whether it should be abolished. My answer is certainly ""No"". Murderers are cruel. And they are usually referred to the violent thugs. They should be sentenced to death. What they put them do put them beyond the pale of humanity. They are not humans and, therefore, they cannot expect to be treated as human beings. They must be made to see the error of their ways, and the only way of doing that is the capital punishment .
Murderers whose motive is money should not get off lightly. The professional killer who would not think twice about using his cosh or crowbar to attack and batter some harmless lady to death in order to rob her meager life-savings. It is absolutely wrong to think professional killer are insane and need hospital treatment, The only thing that is the most suitable to treat him is to punish him the same as the pitying old lady was suffered. Maybe it is too cruel, but it is quite necessary. Criminals must be made to see the consequences of their crimes . ""An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth"" is the very basis of justice .
Capital punishment used to be a major deterrent. It made the violent robber think twice before pulling the trigger. It gave the cold-blooded poisoner something to ponder about while he was shaking up or serving his arsenic cocktail. It protected the most vulnerable members of society, young children, from sex-maniacs. It is horrifying to think that the criminal can literally get away with murder. Therefore, we cannot abolish this punishment, 
Of course some people claim that it is ruthless to punish the murderers by the cosh or hanging. But had the thugs had thought that it was too heartless to the innocent people before they committed the evils. It is not the proper thing they need to worry about. Executing by shooting, hanging or injecting the poison are more humane than the other penalties at present imposed. Thanks to the modem methods the capital punishment is quick and painless. It is only the agitators who campaign against the death penalty who say it is cruel. The reality is that it is a kindness to the murderers. Far better to be shot or hanged than to suffer the slow torture of life imprisonment which is in any case a burden on the long-suffering tax payer.. it is also inevitable that some people are always willing to hold liberal views at the expense of others. It is always fashionable to pose as the defender of the under-dog. So long as you, personally, remain unaffected .
We all know that ""life sentence"" does not mean what it says. It is only a nominal sentence. It leaves a chance for the criminal to escape. After ten years or so of ""good conduct"" the most desperate villain is free to return to society where he will live very comfortably, on the proceeds of his crime, or he will go on committing offences until he is caught again. In no time at all, the murderer will be released. How can ordinary people feel safe knowing that there are murderers on the prowl and probably seeking their next victim? 
Only the capital punishment can ensure that people can sleep safely in their beds.

"Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life. Do you agree or disagree? 
 
What is the purpose of knowledge? Living in the end of the twentieth century is both difficult and easy to answer a question like that. But it is important to do so at least for ourselves .
The Earth with all its secrets, existing long before man had a chance to appear on it, has always been challenging mystery for people. Humans are created tireless investigators, eager discoverers, active thinkers. Knowledge for them is a goal, a condition, pleasure and a leader to improvement of they lives .
It seems logical enough for everybody to see the importance of the discoveries in science - they practically lead to welfare in the material sphere of life, or help to preserve life in the form considered normal. With science fields like Geography, Sociology, History, Law, Political Studies, Language Studies it is a little more difficult to define in what way they are useful in the real world .
Some of them serve society. Some of them just serve people's passion for theorizing, statistics - making, categorizing, going into the abstract. I do not know whether most university degrees are theoretical, but I can well tell about mine, which I am studying at present. It is called ""English and American Studies"" and it is maybe the ideal example of a degree which does not prepare students for the ' real world'. One side of this real world is the opportunities for a professional realization after graduation. Everyone who has heard about this educational programme has asked the question, ""So what would you do after you graduate? Become a teacher?""
Well a difficult question indeed. Having studied all British and American history, literature and culture and having received profound knowledge in the field of linguistics (including Historical Linguistics) the poor graduate finds himself at a loss in a society which either needs him for a teacher, a translator, a tourist guide, or merely as someone who knows English and could sit all day at a secretary's desk, or else for nothing at all. It somehow does not seem ""fair"". Five years' striving in the labyrinth of science and then all knowledge has to be stored in one's consciousness of a learned man .
Of course, in any country different societies exist and the opportunities vary, as well as the values. In my opinion, young people should be well aware of their aims before they apply for a certain degree. If they cannot estimate by themselves, they should be able to receive advise. On the other hand, this means that young people at the age of eighteen have to be able to think as people at the age of twenty-three, which is an awful prospect. The dilemma is clear - either grow old before their time has come or prepare themselves to be disappointed and helpless when it would be late to think with their mature minds .
What I can conclude about this problem is that what we have is not a case so much of inadequate education but rather of inadequate society, because in a modern society there has to be place for all those who deal with impractical science; for knowledge is not a means for making material progress only. If it was, what would man be like?",B2,"{'title': '002_BGSU1018.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Most University degrees are theoretical and do not prepare us for the real life.

"Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
Nowadays, it seems as if money is the most important thing on earth. A lot of people already have a full-time job, but they still go out working in the evenings. And all for one reason: money .
People have become too materialistic anyway. I certainly have to admit that it can be handy to be rich: you can buy everything you want; washing machines, dishwashers, CD-players, video's, cars, or what so ever .
But if you ask me, money isn't the key to happiness at all. I think money offers you more dis - than advantages .
If you become rich, the danger exists that you become more and more egoïstic. But another problem is that rich people can become extremely powerful, especially because they can afford everything. An example of this was Saddam Houssein, the offender of the Gulf War. That man was so rich, that he even didn't know how much he possessed. But because of his large amounts of money, he was able to put pressure on the whole world and he was frightened by everybody. So, you see: money is the root of all evil .
It also has to be very difficult to have a relation, if you are rich. You always have to wonder whether your partner loves you or just your money. And who are your real friends? You always have to doubt about this sorts of things. Other persons may also have this problem, but money certainly makes things more complicated .
Rich people often want more and more money. They would do anything to become richer .
Therefore, it doesn't have to surprise you that riche people can become criminals. they betray other people and even grow richer. I think it is very dreadful that a lot of people don't see the little but so beautiful things in life anymore. They don't see the flowers and the trees and the bees anymore. They are only occupied with themselves .
And what's far more terrible, is that those rich people are respected by the others. They believe that those people have to know a lot, because they are that rich. Well, they are wrong. Cleverness doesn't have anything to do with money at all. Although those rich ones also know this, they often discriminate other people. Sometimes, they behave like they were God .
So far, I have described the rich people as egoïstic. But this certainly doesn't mean that this is a general statement .
Rich people, who want to share their money with others; people, who want to give money to charity funds or what so ever... Well, they are OK. You may have lots of money, as long as you stay simple, you're on the good way .
But I wouldn't like to be in the place of these people either. Having a lot of money also has its consequences .
It isn't the first time, a rich man is kidnapped. You also have to be more frightened on the street. Because people are able to see whether you are rich or not .
For all these reasons, I believe, it's much better to stay simple.

"Gary and Me

The restaurant owner John Moore writes about his relationship with his son Gary, the famous TV chef.
I believe everyone's given a chance in life. My son, Gary, was given his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I rushed over to look at the place. It was in a really bad state. It was perfect for what I had in mind.
Coming into this business made me recall my childhood. I can remember my mother going out to work in a factory and me being so upset because I was left alone. With that in mind, I thought, 'We want time for family life.' My wife dedicated herself to looking after the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived over the restaurant in those days, and we always put a lot of emphasis on having meals together. It's paid dividends with our children, Gary and Joe. They're both very confident. Also, from a very early age they would come down and talk to our regular customers. It's given both of them a great start in life.
Gary was quite a lively child when he was really small. We had a corner bath, and when he was about seven he thought he'd jump into it like a swimming pool, and he knocked himself out. When he was older he had to work for pocket money. He started off doing odd jobs and by the age of about ten he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had loads of money at school. He had discipline. He used to be up even before me in the morning. If you run a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out.
Gary wasn't very academic, but he shone so much in the kitchen. By the age of 15 he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even left in charge. He would produce over a hundred meals, and from then I knew he'd go into catering because he had that flair. So when he came to me and said, 'Dad, I've got to do work experience as part of my course at school,' I sent him to a friend of mine who's got a restaurant.
Gary recently took up playing the drums and now he has his own band. Goodness knows what will happen to the cooking if the music takes off. My advice to Gary would be: if you start chasing two hares, you end up catching neither, so chase the hare you know you're going to catch. He understood when I said to him: 'Gary, if you're going to get anywhere in life, you've got to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it's too late.'
Gary went to catering college at the age of 17, and on his first day he and the other new students -they're normally complete beginners - were given what's supposed to be a morning's work. But within an hour Gary had chopped all his vegetables, sliced all his meats. He'd prepared everything. That's my son for you! In the end, he was helping other people out.
None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cookery series has become. I'm extremely proud of him. I've always tried to tell him that if you want something, you've got to work jolly hard for it, because no one gives you anything. He's seen the opportunity he's been given and grabbed hold of it with both hands. You know, you talk to your children as they grow up, and if they only take in ten per cent of what you've told them, you've got to be happy with that. The things Gary says, the things he does, I think, well, he must have listened sometimes.",B2,"{'title': '30.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Gary and Me\n\nThe restaurant owner John Moore writes about his relationship with his son Gary, the famous TV chef.\nI believe everyone's given a chance in life.

"Tony and his mother got on a bus in the middle of the town. At first they drove through streets of small, grey houses. Then the bus left the town and drove along a country road.
The bus stopped in every village. Tony saw green fields and small, quiet villages. Every house had a garden. The smell of the flowers came in through the open windows of the bus.
At last the bus stopped. Tony could see a river and an old bridge. A small road ran across the bridge, through the fields and over a hill. 'Come on, Tony,' said his mother. They got out of the bus and walked two kilometres in the hot sun. There were white and yellow flowers at the side of the road. Tony did not know their names. He wanted to know more about them. He wanted to know more about the trees too. There were no flowers or trees in his street.
He looked at the cows in the fields.
'I've never seen a real cow,' he said to himself. He watched them moving very slowly through the long, green grass. They looked big and quiet.
Tony and his mother arrived at the farmhouse and walked through the farmyard. Chickens were looking for food. A fat white cat sat on a wall and watched them with sleepy eyes.
Mr Wood came to the door and spoke to Tony's mother. 'Hullo, Betty. It's nice to see you again. Thank you for your letter. How are you?' They talked together like old friends.

Thousands of years ago there was an ancient man who needed something he could not get or gain alone. So he went searching, searching for another man who could possibly have that something. When he finally found him, it appeared that this particular man missed something, too, something that the first man had more than he needed. That was an evident bargain. They changed, they bartered, and both could now have all the things they needed to survive .
That is how bartering possibly may have begun. Somewhere, someone had got something; and somewhere else, a few miles away, someone else had got something else . ""You take a sackful of this if I can have a sackful of that."" And the both agreed. The first problem those ancient men probably faced was: ""What about if what I have and the other fellow needs is scantier and more valuable, far rarer than the stuff the other fellow has and I need? I should definitely have more, maybe double the amount than the other fellow. I take two sackfuls of your thing, you will only get one sackful of mine.""
Sometimes it was easy and fair. Both agreed and were happy. But sooner or later they faced difficulties. They must have disagreed on the bartering conditions at some point. And then they had to invent a tool, a means of trading. First the means might have been skins of animals, then valuable metals like gold, then special pieces of gold which later developed to round coins, then paper with different symbols indicating its value and, finally, data signals controlled by plastic cards and computer systems .
Definitely the development of trading means has made trading a great deal easier. But what else has the introduction of money brought with it? From the very beginning, when it was determined and commonly adopted that silver and gold would be of value and a measure of richness, there have been people who have gathered them and become devoted to gathering them. And then the ever-growing passion for wealth spread along with the growing civilization and began to touch every corner of the world. And no good can be expected when money becomes a drug, an obsession, where always more and more has to be gained. Life becomes easier, but only materially easier when one has got a lot of money. One does not have to care about his subsistence or survival. Who would not like to lead an easy life without serious material concern?
And man, in his greed, was very cunning, too. He created a ruling and controlling system; he created a pecking order where the richest men control those who are not as rich while they together master ""average folk"" who, joining the richer ones, control together poor people who still have the opportunity to trample on even poorer people - the poorest of all. Those who are rich have got the power to master and make decisions and, after all, they get more wealth. More wealth brings more power, more power brings even more wealth, and so on. The continuing vicious circle (vicious to the poor and the idealists only) is ready. The table is set, the money meal is served for the rich. The oppression may begin .
This principle of the connection between money and power has been applied successfully many times during the history of mankind. A good example is the colonialism of European countries in the last centuries. Already more civilized, industrialized and technically developed Europeans who had moderately high standard of living, had got the power and could easily conquer land in Africa and South America. There people used to lead a simple life and could not resist. Soon were the whole two continents divided between conquerers. The result was that the rich got more and the poor were left with even less that they used to have .
This story can be told again and again and it happens all the time in different disguises. Greed for money has been the source of many bad acts and the reason for many sad things that have happened. But so have power, might, war, organized religion and many other kinds of addictions as well. And none of them shows itself alone : all are connected in a way.

"Science flying in the face of gravity

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories.

It looked like just another aircraft from the outside. The pilot told his young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger craft.
But appearances were deceptive and the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were in for the flight of their lives. Inside, it had become a long white tunnel.
There were almost no windows, but it was eerily illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been ripped out, apart from a few at the back, where the pale-faced, budding scientists took their places with the air of condemned men.
For 12 months, they had competed with other students from across the continent to participate in the flight. The challenge, offered by the European Space Agency, had been to suggest imaginative experiments to be conducted in weightless conditions.
Those with the best ideas won a place on this unusual flight, which is best described as the most extraordinary roller-coaster ride yet devised. For the next two hours the Boeing's flight would resemble that of an enormous bird which had lost its reason, shooting upwards towards the heavens before hurtling towards Earth.
The intention was to achieve a kind of state of grace at the top of each curve. As the pilot cuts the engines at 3,000 metres, the aircraft throws itself still higher by virtue of its own momentum before gravity takes over and it plummets earthwards again.
In the few silent seconds between ascending and falling, the aircraft and everything inside it become weightless, and the 13 students would, in theory, feel themselves closer to the moon than the Earth. The aircraft took off smoothly enough, but any lingering illusions the young scientists and I had that we were on anything like a scheduled passenger service were quickly dispelled when the pilot put the Boeing into a 45-degree climb which lasted around 20 seconds. The engines strained wildly, blood drained from our heads, and bodies were scattered across the cabin floor.
Then the engines cut out and the transition to weightlessness was nearly instantaneous. For 20 seconds we conducted a ghostly dance in the unreal silence:the floor had become a vast trampoline, and one footstep was enough to launch us headlong towards the ceiling.
We floated aimlessly; the idea of going anywhere was itself confusing. Left or right, up or down, no longer had any meaning. Only gravity, by rooting us somewhere, permits us to appreciate the possibility of going somewhere else.
After ten seconds of freefall descent, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its nose dive. The return of gravity was less immediate than its loss, but was still sudden enough to ensure that some of the students came down with a bump.
Our first curve completed, there were those who turned green at the thought of the 29 to follow. Thirty curves added up to ten minutes 'space time’ for experiments and the Dutch students were soon studying the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, hoping to discover how it is that cats always land on their feet.
At the appropriate moment the device they had built to investigate this was released, floating belly-up, and one of the students succeeded in turning it belly-down with radio-controlled movements. The next curve was nearly its last, however, when another student landed on top of it during a less well managed return to gravitational pull.
Next to the slightly stunned acrobatic robocat, a German team from the University of Aachen investigated how the quality of joins in metal is affected by the absence of gravity, with an eye to the construction of tomorrow's space stations.
Another team of students, from Utah State University, examined the possibility of creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened in ultra-violet sunlight. Their flight was spent attempting to produce the films under microgravity. They believe that once the process is perfected, satellites could be equipped with solar sails that use the sun's radiation just as a yacht's sails use the wind. 
After two hours spent swinging between heaven and Earth, that morning’s breakfast felt unstable, but the predominant sensation was exhilaration, not nausea.
This was a feeling that would stay with us for a long time. ‘It was an unforgettable experience,’ said one of the students. 'I was already aiming to become an astronaut, but now I want to even more.’",C1,"{'title': '8120c2b8-1cfd-407a-b6c9-95d0a455fd05.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Science flying in the face of gravity\n\nJournalist Tom Mumford joins students using weightlessness to test their theories.\n\nIt looked like just another aircraft from the outside.

"Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
This time I want to think about teaching English. When I was high school student, I liked to study English, but I didn't like English class because how to teach English by teacher did not interest me. Therefore, I was bored and sometimes slept in English class. Now, from my experiences as student I want to give three ideas of teaching English .
First, teacher should be communicating with students well. It is not good that teacher just speak one-side because to just listen to teachers talking is too boring, and students will not be interested in English classes. In actual, they translate English into Japanese themselves, so student's English skills will not be better. Also it is good for students to tell their opinions and feelings because their English skills will improve well for doing so. To present their opinions and talk with teacher will make an impression for students, so students will not forget easy. Moreover, if what students say in English can tell the other students and teacher, they can feel that English is fun and it interests them. For these reasons, I think that communication between teacher and students is very important .
Second, I think that it is good to see and hear natural English. I think that Assistant English teachers who are English native speakers are good for students because students can learn a lot of how to talk from not only textbook also daily conversation with native speaker. Then, native speaker's pronunciation and attitude are different from Japanese, so they act as encouragement to students. For that reason, teacher had better give a lot of chances for students to talk with native speaker. Also, Japanese teacher had better speak English fluently because students imitate teacher's pronunciations. If teacher's pronunciation is not good, student cannot improve their pronunciation of English well, like this I think that teacher should speak natural English. For these reasons, to experience native or natural English is good for students .
Third, all of students should always join classes. I think that students had better feel a little tension in their classes because if they do not feel tension, they don't think well themselves. It is best that teacher make an atmosphere both friendly and tense. Though it is hard that there is a mood of nervous, students will step up their English skills for being call on them. If they don't answer correct, they can learn from mistaking. For that reason, teacher had better put some pressure on their students. Moreover, to pronounce all of students together is good because students will learn for pronouncing again and again, and they can understand well. For these purposes, teacher should have students joining classes well .

"A heavy step sounded at the door and a man came in.
'We have company, Johann,' said my hostess, and the man pulled off his cap.
The moment he looked at me, to my surprise he took a step back as though, like the border official, he had seen something surprising.
'What's the matter, Johann?' asked the older girl. 'This is a gentleman on his travels, come to see the coronation.'
The man had calmed himself, but he was looking at me in a strange, almost fierce, manner.

'I beg your pardon, sir,' said Johann.
I then said good night to them all and rose to my feet. The young girl ran to light the way to my room. Johann still looked at me strangely as I passed. While the girl was leading me up the stairs, she said: 'Master Johann could never be pleased with one of your colouring, sir.'
'Perhaps he prefers yours,' I suggested.
'I meant, sir, in a man.'
'What,' I asked, 'does hair colour matter in a man?'
'I don't know, sir, but I like yours - it's the Elphberg red.'
'Colour in a man,' said I, 'is a matter of no more importance than that!' - and I gave her something of no value.

"Ancient Chinese medicine in the West?

Acupuncture is two thousand years old. It comes from the traditional Chinese system of medicine that includes herbalism, massage, diet, manipulation and exercise. It is used to treat many different conditions, but acupuncture's role in treating pain has received most attention by doctors in the West. Some GPs, midwives and physios use it regularly for pain relief.

A. What's it all about? 

Traditional Chinese medicine sees health as a state in which the energy of the mind, body and spirit are in harmony. According to the theory, energy or Qi (pronounced chee) flows around the body along lines called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each linked to an internal organ, and lots of tiny meridians take Qi to every cell. When the flow of Oi is upset, blocked or weakened, the body is said to be out of balance: weakness or illness may result. During a consultation with a traditional acupuncturist, he or she will try to find where imbalances occur in the Qi. This is done by feeling pulses on your wrist, examining your tongue and assessing your general appearance. He or she will ask about your medical history, current health, general well-being, state of mind, and your eating and sleeping habits. An acupuncturist uses fine needles inserted into the skin. He or she may also apply warmth from smouldering herbs or pressure at points on meridians, to stimulate the flow of Qi.

B. Over three hundred points
 
The points used for acupuncture are related to meridians so won't necessarily be near the site of the complaint. People often say they feel a not unpleasant dull ache or tingling sensation when the needle is gently manipulated. This is either done by hand or by attaching the needle to an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists say this sensation shows the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian.
There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with hundreds more elsewhere that are used less often.

C. Science tells us how

Without accepting the principles of traditional Chinese medicine, doctors here have accepted that acupuncture can work for pain relief. This is because they have been able to provide scientific explanations of how it might work. For example: 
* It has been suggested that stimulating particular nerves blocks pain signals and stops them from reaching the brain.
* Some scientists believe that stimulating acupuncture points releases natural pain-relieving substances (endorphins).

D. What type of pain can be treated?

Many people with chronic long-term pain turn to acupuncture as a last resort. Back pain, spots injuries, arthritis, headaches and migraine and post-operative pain are commonly treated with acupuncture.
Other types of pain which acupuncturists claim to treat include menstrual pain, facial nerve pain and pain suffered by terminally ill people.

E. Modern use for an ancient treatment

Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, one development has been rather more recent. The use of acupuncture instead of anaesthesia during surgery only started in the 1950s. It was this that helped to convince some doctors outside China that there was more to acupuncture than mind over matter.
In China today, acupuncture is used during all sorts of operations, from tonsillectomies to caesareans, and is even used in open heart surgery. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation or with drugs. It's claimed that the pain is more or less eliminated, but it varies from person to person. It's hard to imagine many of us finding the option of lying awake on the operating table very attractive. But acupuncturists say that acupuncture anaesthesia involves none of the side-effects of conventional anaesthetics (e.g. nausea), and you recover from it more quickly.

F. Always effective

As with most complementary therapies, clinical trials to evaluate acupuncture are difficult to run. But trials that have been done have shown that 50 to 80 per cent of people find acupuncture effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally quote a similar success rate. They accept that it won't work for everyone and that people vary in their responsiveness.
Traditional acupuncturists say that for chronic long-term pain it will usually take between six and seven visits for people to feel real relief. But some improvement should be felt after just two or three visits.

G. A different approach to pain

But Western and Chinese medicine view pain rather differently. Like most alternative therapists, an acupuncturist views his or her patient in a holistic way. This means not just focusing on specific symptoms. An acupuncturist spends a long time making a diagnosis, trying to find underlying weaknesses in the Oi. He or she will also want to know what external factors are causing the pain. For instance, is the pain worse in the cold, heat, damp or wind? Does it feel sharp, dull, throbbing, constant or burning? These are seen as important factors in deciding how acupuncture can be used to treat the pain. It's unlikely that your average medical doctor would take such things into account, isn't it?

H. Traditional or not?

Some medical professionals do have traditional acupuncture training. Others - including many GPs who practise acupuncture reject traditional Chinese theory and subscribe to scientific explanations.
But many traditional acupuncturists believe that only by applying traditional Chinese medicine is it possible to bring about deep changes that lead to a longer cure - something that is very difficult to assess in trials.
Care should always be taken in choosing an acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for funner investigation if necessary.",C1,"{'title': '28.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Ancient Chinese medicine in the West?\n\nAcupuncture is two thousand years old.

"Title: Buying mobile phones for children under 14 is the parents' responsibility

Nowadays, we are overwhelmed with mobile phones, and we cannot imagine communication without them. During the last decades, they became inseparable from us as if they were part of our body. However, we seem to ignore the harmful effects caused by mobile phones. These phones, especially when used by children under a certain age, can damage the brain by changing the structure of neurons. In addition, children can easily become addicted to mobile phones which, in turn, will influence their achievement in school. Therefore, on my opinion, parents should not allow children under 14 to buy mobile phones.
There is a critical age for children, when their organs are most prone to be damaged. Under the age of 14 children's brains have not reached the developmental stage of an adult's brain, therefore they are more sensitive to the effects of mobile phones. According to several research studies carried out by medical universities, children, who used mobile phones before their fourteenth birthday, had serious mutation in their neurons which, in some cases, led to abnormal changes in their brains as well. Comparing these results with those of the control group, it was asserted that the neurons of the control group's members retained their original forms.
Besides the physiological effects of mobile phones, the psychological effects also play an important part in influencing children's life. In fact, psychological addiction can cause more damage in children's than physiological effects. For instance if a child takes up the habit of playing on his/her mobile phone all day then his/her attention will not be concentrated on his/her duties in school. As a result he/she will lag behind his/her schoolmates and this will worsen the chances in his/her later progress in school.
Parents, as the representatives of the opponent side may claim that it is useful to buy mobile phones for children even if these children are under fourteen because with the help of the phones children can be easily reached at any time. To a certain extent they may be right, however, their opinion can be debated. Few decades ago when mobile phones were even not heard of, parents knew about their children's location their programmes without the use of any technical device. In order to arrange such affairs such harmful means as mobile phones are not needed at all.
To sum up, it can be asserted that mobile phones are highly responsible for physiological as well as for psycological damage which endanger children who have not reached the age of fourteen and thus are the most sensitive to these effects. Thus, responsible parents who take into consideration their children's physical and mental health will not buy mobile phones for their children.",C1,"{'title': '191_HUEL4045.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: Buying mobile phones for children under 14 is the parents' responsibility\n\nNowadays, we are overwhelmed with mobile phones, and we cannot imagine communication without them.

"I may be too old for this lark, but here goes!
At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He ponders what has made him -- and others of hi sage -- take the plunge.
This summer, I quit my job and resolved to rent out my flat and go travelling in South East Asia for a yeaL You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old, and I'm nervous.
It's not as if I haven't done the travelling thing before. After university, I spent two years backpacking around North and South America, and when I returned. was determined to do it again some day, But you know how it is ... I fell in love, embarked on a career, bought a Hat and got used to earning a salary. But I gradually realised I had been sacrificing my own sense of worth for my salary. When I handed in that letter of resignation, it felt as though I'd taken charge of my life again.
I now have no tics. Many of my friends are now married with children and, while they wouldn't swap places with me, they envy me my lack of responsibilities. I'm no longer in a relationship, and I have no burning career ambitions. I feel almost obliged to make the most of that freedom - if only for my friends' sake!
Why am I so nervous? In the first place, 1t's a question of making the necessary arrangements. How could I bear to have someone else living in my home? And how would I go about organising the letting? And apart from anything else, I had to decide where to go.
T'm a shocking procrastinator. and am already several weeks behind my intended schedule. 'Might as well enjoy the summer in England,' I told myself. Then, 'Why not hang around for the start of the football season?' Severing emotional ties makes it even more difficult.
I'm putting it off because, deep down, I wonder if I can still cope with backpacking. Will I be able to readjust to a more basic wav of life? Will I feel out of place among a community of backpackers fresh out of school and university?
Perhaps not. I've discovered it's increasingly common for Britons in their late twenties and thirties to want to disentangle themselves from the lives they've made for themselves and head ofT for foreign climes.
Jennifer Cox, of Lonely Planet guidebook publishers, identifies a growing awareness that adventure is there for the raking: 'The penny's dropped. The sort of people who always say ""I wish I'd had that opportunity"" are realising that they can have it any time they want. They just have to be brave enough and organised enough and confident enough to do it.'

They have bought 'I round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm prepared to sacrifice job security to have the trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a niggling thought at the back of your mind that. ""OK, I'm not moving up the career ladder, I'm going to be in the same position I was in before when I come back,"" but I think it's a risk you have to take, When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a ceremonial act of defiance!'
For Matt, who'd just got out of the Army, the year he spent travelling amounted to a period of metamorphosis. 'When you're in the military, there's a set wav of doing things, a pattern to the way you approach problems. I went away because I really needed to temper this, and get rid of this approach in some cases, in order to have a reasonable existence as a civilian.'
While there are as many reasons to go travelling at my time of life as there are travellers, there do seem to be common factors. 'We have a much more flexible workforce today,' says Angela Baron of the Institute of Personnel Development. 'There are more people working on short-term contracts and so if your contract's just come to an end you've got nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even adopting career-break policies. 'If you've spent a lot of time and money training someone, it's nice to know they're coming back at some point rather than going to work for a competitor.'
For Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a publishing company that specialises in the tales of 'ordinary' travellers, an increasing number of thirty-somethings are taking stock of their lives. 'If you're nor happy doing what you're doing - and many people aren't - it's no longer a question of just seeing it through. Now people are aware that opportunities exist and that a job isn't ""for life"" any more. Travel offers a chance to reassess, to take a step back and think about your life.'
Is giving in to wanderlust just another example of my generation's inability to come to terms with adulthood? Jennifer Cox thinks nor. 'It's a sign of a better educated, more stable society when we're less concerned with paving the bills than wanting to live a balanced life. We're actually taking the time to ask ""Is this what I want?""
Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher heading off to Central America for a year , does nor believe he's running away. 'It's more a case of running towards something. It's trying to grab some things that I want for myself' But he does feel some trepidation. 'It's the thought of what I'm leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just the act of going into the office every day. saying ""hi"" to everyone and sitting down with a cup of coffee.'
I share Ben's reservations about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges and I'm nor sure I'd be making this journey if [ hadn't found my boss so intolerable. As Jennifer Cox points out: 'This is fairly typical. There's often a catalyst. like the break-up of a relationship or the loss of a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.'
It may have taken a helpful kick up the backside to get me moving, but I'm now approaching the next 12 months with a mounting sense of excitement.

It\'s trying to grab some things that I want for myself\' But he does feel some trepidation. \'It\'s the thought of what I\'m leaving behind, that comfortable routine - just the act of going into the office every day. saying ""hi"" to everyone and sitting down with a cup of coffee.\'\nI share Ben\'s reservations about leaving behind an ordered life with few challenges and I\'m nor sure I\'d be making this journey if [ hadn\'t found my boss so intolerable. As Jennifer Cox points out: \'This is fairly typical. There\'s often a catalyst. like the break-up of a relationship or the loss of a job. Such an event can push people to go and do it.\'\nIt may have taken a helpful kick up the backside to get me moving, but I\'m now approaching the next 12 months with a mounting sense of excitement.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
Many people have a very negative idea of the women's liberation movement and have a lot of prejudices against it. They imagine that feminists are egoistic, ugly, frustrated, lesbian women. And the thought that feminism has done more harm than good to the cause of women often comes to their minds. However, if it hadn't been for some strong women who enchained this emancipation movement, how would have been the women's situation today ? Would we have a right to vote? And what about going to university or having a job ? If we have a look at the feminist movement from its beginning until now, it becomes clear that many positive changes have taken place thanks to feminists. One should also keep in mind that the present feminist movement is not one coherent organisation. There are several groups, all having their own views, own theories and own goals. The media often focalises on the most striking groups, on those feminists who attract attention by their radical actions, actions that are not always approved of by everybody. In this way some people may have a one-sided and negative view on feminism .
in the 19 th Century the first women's organisations arose. During this first period of feminism the women's liberation movement sought equal rights for women, regarding work, education and politics. The marriage articles ( a divorce was almost impossible at the time) and the laws concerning prostitution had to be altered. They also demanded information on contraception and of course a right to vote. In 1870 British wives got the right for property. In 1919 they were allowed to run for Parliament . Not until 1928 they got the right to vote, after a long strife of the suffragettes, Other countries followed this example .
This was just the beginning. In the 1960's a new sort of feminism showed up in the U.S.. A second period of feminism had dawned. From now on the women's liberation movement concentrated more on the women and less on political rights. The idea that women not only have to strife after the granting of equal rights ( women's emancipation but also after the abolition af the behaviour and thinking patterns that discriminated against women ( liberation ) gained more and more interest. These ""new"" feminists wanted to change the prevailing stereotypes of women as weak, passive and dependant individuals who are less rational and more emotional than men. Their goal was to obtain more freedom for women to work and an equal responsability for men and women in the houshold. They criticised the emphasis on women as objects of sexual desire in society. They wanted to broaden the selfawareness of women and the opportunities to the point of equality with men. Also the advancement of women's participation in political decision making and other areas of public life was important .
The U.S. declared 1975 as International Women's Year. Conscious-raising groups, women studies, pubs for women, houses for women, magazines for women ... originated. Things we consider now as self-evident. Still, the women's liberation movement meets a lot of resistance among men as well as women .
The diversity of the movement may cause some problems. All those different groups, all those disagreements and quarrels among feminists often make a bad impression on outsiders. It is difficult to put all these bits and pieces together. And of course not all parts are acceptable. On the other hand, because of the complexity of the women's situation today, it is perhaps not so bad that different groups try to handle tings in their own way. In general you could discern three groups (with fundamental differences): the middle-of-the-road feminists, the socialists and the radical feminists. The first group considers the structure of society as the oppressor of women. The social feminists mean that capitalism is the cause of the inequality. According to the third group, man is the oppressor, so women have to disengage themselves of the male society and they have to create a society of their own .
With this brief sketch of the development of the women's liberation movement and some of its achievements, I think that it is clear that some of the negative opinions on feminists are unfounded. Thanks to the feminist movement the women's place in society has approved. Many things (like the right to vote, magazines for women...) that we now find self-evident, didn't exist two centuries ago. The women's emancipation movement has done some great things but there is still a long way to go. We are unaware of the way in which some of our thoughts confirm the traditional patterns of men and women. The way in which we act and think has a lot to do with messages and examples we get from our birth on, unconscious.

"Queen Victoria restored the reputation of a monarchy tarnished by the extravagance of her royal uncles. She also shaped a new role for the Royal Family, reconnecting it with the public through civic duties.
At just 4ft 11in tall, Victoria was a towering presence as a symbol of her Empire. She and her husband Albert and their nine children came to symbolise a new, confident age.
Alexandrina Victoria was born to the Duchess of Kent. Her father was the fourth son of George III and she was fifth in line to the throne.
However, she had three elderly uncles ahead of her in the succession. So when her father died when she was eight months her prospects of becoming queen were good. The princess, known as Victoria, was raised at Kensington Palace. She was educated by her governess Baroness Lehzen, who taught her languages, arithmetic, drawing and music. Her widowed mother was lonely and depended utterly on John Conroy – a servant of her former husband who was bent on power.
After the death of two uncles, the teenage Victoria became heir to her final surviving uncle King William IV.
But Victoria's youth was dominated by strict rules known as the 'Kensington System'. These rules included sharing a room with her mother and having no time alone. The system was designed by John Conroy, who hoped to manipulate her to gain further power and influence. When Victoria was 13 she was taken on a tour of the Midlands so that Conroy and her mother could show her off to the public. The princess found it exhausting and became increasingly stubborn. She started writing a diary.",B2,"{'title': 'text_223.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Queen Victoria restored the reputation of a monarchy tarnished by the extravagance of her royal uncles.

"England's breakfast revolution 

The importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts, but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England, with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature. Admittedly, there are scattered references to travellers having a meal at dawn before embarking on arduous journeys, and to the sick sitting down to breakfast for medicinal reasons, but most people went without unless they were monarchs or nobles. 
However, in the sixteenth century it gradually became the norm, not the exception. Some writers have attributed this to the greater availability of food. Proponents of this view have not always considered other profound social changes. For example, new patterns of employment may well offer a plausible explanation for the greater importance now attached to breakfast, as individuals were increasingly employed for a prescribed number of hours. Often this involved starting work extremely early. Thus, having a meal first thing in the morning was rooted in necessity, and was no longer associated with social status alone.",C2,"{'title': '65.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""England's breakfast revolution \n\nThe importance of a good breakfast is beyond dispute according to health experts, but in historical terms breakfast is a relatively new arrival in England, with descriptions of breakfast seldom featuring in medieval literature.

"Life was quiet after Uncle Ben died. Peter and Harry worked hard at school and soon their last year was over. Everyone's family came to school on the last day.
'Good news, Peter,' Harry said. 'My dad bought a flat for me in Manhattan. And there's a room for you.'
'That's great!' said Peter.
Then Harry's father arrived.
'You did it,' Mr Osborn said to Harry. He was a little surprised but also very happy. 'Good work!'
Then he turned to Peter. 'And Peter - the best science student in the school! That's fantastic!'
Mr Osborn looked at Peter. 'Life isn't easy for you right now,' he said. Try to enjoy the day. It's the start of something new.' Then he smiled. 'You're almost a brother to Harry. That makes you family.'
Peter smiled back. But he was frightened. His 'spider sense' saw something terrible in Mr Osborn's eyes.
Harry saw MJ and Flash. MJ didn't look happy. Flash looked very angry. Then Flash walked away.
'It's over for MJ and Flash,' thought Harry. 'Good!'
Later that day, Peter sat quietly at home. He thought about Uncle Ben and he started to cry. Then he remembered Uncle Ben's words. 'With great power comes great responsibility.' Something in Peter woke up.
'I'm strong,' he thought. 'And I'm a good person. I must help other people. Uncle Ben was right!'
A few weeks later, Peter walked alone through the streets of Manhattan. Suddenly, he saw MJ come out of a restaurant.
'Hi, MJ!' he called.
'Hi!' she smiled. 'What are you doing around here?'

In the words of the old song ""Money is the root of all evil"".
It's not exactly what headline said, I think, but some of this is true .
We know God told to the man that he would earn his food with swear of his forehead; in other words, without work there isn't food. We must understand that food is between all necessyties men have. Consecuently everything men have more than they need are for their amusement .
And here is where starts the trouble .
It's very good for men all kinds of amusements but when their amusements are more than thoses they need men start to try other things generally prohibitive. And ¿why men try to find other things they don't need? ... Because he has money .
There are lot of things men can buy, can do, can try, can ... etc... that aren't necessary either. But if men haven't money they can't do prohibitive things .
On the other hand, wasting more money meaning way to try to obten more. so it's going to be a circle that can not end .
Then come the necessity to earn more and in this way it goes to ambition, and ambition is blind when it takes root in the man .
There is anything can stop then when men are blind with ambition .
We have heard sometimes that who has too much likes to have more and more and we always want more and more, because ambition never find his end .
Solution for that kind of problem is given for us by lot of very prominent persons who tell us that in the middle way is where we can find virtue. So if we have more money we need what we have to do is to invent, to spend in something to help people or to make lif better. Why there are wars ... why there are hungries...
It's not because there aren't money but because we don't distribute well money .
But it is true that sometimes we have more money because it gives us security and, importance, etc... and we don't like lose that because if we lose that other will be over us. We have fear too. And it is true that when some people lose their ones gain .
How many wars, how many problems have had men with money...
After a war men think, are more careful and goods are better distributed; but little by little, step by step, ambition gives taken root in men again .
It is a very serious thing to think about. We all have to contribute for that. We all have to take mesures to solve the problems in the best way we can .

"Title: The prison system is outdated; no civilized society should punish its criminals. It should rehabilitate them. Do you agree or disagree with the statement above? 

There is no any doubt about it that, prison is a dangerous place, especially for those who enter it as the first time, have no concept of respect, and those who have been locked up the longest automatically receive deference for the time they have served. But the greatest danger is about officers working there: prison guards, who have pleasure with playing games with prisoners' lives. And, the staffs' violence, generally does not report also the reason for the attack, which is usually a form of prison flow.
Some people believed that private prisons are the answer for better conditions. But will private prison mean that more people will be put in jail for a longer time, to increase the owners profit (since the owner gets paid a set fee per prisoner per day). Will the private prison owners cut back on the prisoners benefits to save money? Do they prepare better conditions for the prisoners such as: better quality of food for the prisoners, gym, swimming pool, prisoners libraries, prisoner televisions entertainers who come to entertain the prisoners, prisoners computers for entertainment, rehabilitation program, medical care to the prisoners, or for saving more money they have already lower salaries for prison employees so the prisoners will get lower quality service by low level prison employees who have to accept low wages due to as they name: their low level skills? 

Or will the private Prisons somehow be good for whatever reasons! But the fact is that although government tried to give responsibility to private section but the situation of prisons are still Very bad, because profit becomes the first priority instead of rehabilitation. Here is a fact: a prison is a prison. That's all. Prisons are not meant to be good places to be. They are not resort communities where people lie around and have to work unwillingly. There are no psychoanalysis treatments.

There are gangs and violence all around the prisons, and while these are prevalent, it is not as necessary as some might have you believe to become involved with them.

Groups which are gather under a name of a person who usually is done the worst crucial and savage action and the group have a name chosen by him.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 
 
The education in university is important for many people all around the world and so many people are giving effort to take a place in university classroom. In addition to this three questions come in to our mind. Firstly, why do people want to go university? And then is the education given in universities enough? Does the universities really prepare students for the real world? I will try to answer these questions in this article .
The answer to first question is having a better job. The university degree provide people a statue and a chance to have a job wherever they want. When you apply for a good job, in a company the first question is wheather you have university degree or not. I think the reason of this is having many unemployment people and this is a good way to choose which person is more qualified. That's why you need a university degree. In contrast to this, having only degree is not a criteria . also, you should develop yourself too. When it comes to the second question which asks whether the universities' education is enough or not. Answer is both yes and no depending on department and quality of the university. Students learn everything about their department in class environment. Mostly they don't use what they have learned practically. In exams mostly theoritical questions are asked and students recite and answer .
Education is enough in regard to theoritical knowledge, on the other hand when it comes to practising they fail. Of course it isn't like that in each department of the university. For instance in Medical Department students take both theoric and practical knowledge. Especially during last two years they start to behave as a doctor. But in Engineering Department students make every projects on a paper. I didn't see an engineer candidate make a real robot or machine . If we think about teaching department practicum education is not enough. Whatever students learn important or unimportant, they have less chance to use them. They also attend practicum school but i think it is not enough. In lessons most of them can tell the course but it is different to teach young learners then advanced ones. I don't know whether there is a solution to this or not. Of course experts know better then me. As you see from the examples education in university are different in each department .
Third question looks for whether the universities prepaire students for real life. My answer is yes. Students cannot have practical knowledge. But university is a good chance for a person to grow himself and to learn how to stand on their own foot. University life have both happy times and tough times. Students may feel themself alone, bores , sort of money, crazy, strong, weak...etc. I have encountered all these situations in my university life. Moreover, students are trying to have a relationship with the people who have different characters. So that they learn hhow to tolerate people, not to trust everyone except themselves. However the most important thing is whatever you face, you learn how to stand on and how to survive .
To sum up, university is a part of our life. We have taken theorical knowledges and we have gone to school just the purpose of going but what we have gained is we have learned many things in university life without realizing. I don't agree that universities doesn't have value. In contrast, university has so much value in all over the world.

"As far as I am concerned, I indeed think that studying abroad should be a compulsory part of education. However when I say ""education"", I mean higher school or university. Whatever three or five years, every student should spend at least six months abroad. First and foremost, from a personal point of view, it allows the student to be out of his confort zone which is a essential step in every life. It forces the youth to discover another culture, sometimes even another language, enabling him to come back in his country more open-minded, critical, aware of what happening outside of his borders.

"Fun at the Dentist's?

If you walk into W. Lloyd Jerome's dental surgery in the centre of Glasgow, you'll see bright modern paintings on the wall and a fashionable blue couch which patients sit on while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, 'Fifty per cent of the population only go to the dentist when they're in pain rather than attending for regular check- ups. That's because they're frightened.'
To counteract this, he has tried to create an environment where people are not afraid. 
That's why I took the decision not to wear a white coat. I find that's one of the things that people associate with pain. In fact, my philosophy is that dental treatment should take place in an atmosphere of relaxation, interest and above all enjoyment.'
Which is all highly shocking for anyone (most of us in fact) who has learnt to associate dental treatment with pain, or at the very least, with formal, clinical visits. Jerome says, 'If people are relaxed, entertained and correctly treated, they will forget such previous negative experiences.'.
Virtual-reality headsets are one of his new relaxation techniques. 'We were the first practice in Britain to introduce them and they're proving very popular. The headsets are used for the initial check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I look at their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera, to give the patient a visual tour around their mouth.' Surprisingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit to the dentists.
Another key point is that the surgery smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's. Today there is the smell of orange. Jerome explains, 'When people walk in, I want them to realise with all their senses that it's not like going to the dentist's. Smell is very important. That dental smell of surgical spirit can get the heart racing in minutes if you're frightened of dentists.' I certainly found the delicate smell in the surgery very pleasant.
Although he is known as Glasgow's most fashionable dentist,Jerome is keen to point out that he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important but the quality of the treatment is of course the most important thing.
For example, Jerome uses a special instrument which sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them, rather than scraping them. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it's not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to do research into dental techniques. 'One of the things I found out there was that when you make it easier for the patient you make it easier for yourself', he explains. He sees his patient-centred attitude as the start of a gradual movement towards less formality in the conservative British dentistry profession.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome rushes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks him what video he'd like to watch and leads him gently towards the chair. The patient seems to be enjoying this five-star treatment and no wonder.

"It was just after dark one windy evening in the autumn of 1844. I was with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in the library of his Paris apartment. For one hour at least we had been sitting in profound silence. Dupin seemed content just to watch the smoke rising from his pipe. As for myself, I was thinking about the affair of the Rue Morgue. More particularly I was thinking about how quickly Dupin had solved the case when the police could do nothing. It was therefore something of a coincidence when our old acquaintance Monsieur G of the Paris police arrived at the door.
G explained that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business that had caused a great deal of trouble.
""And what is the difficulty now?"" I asked. ""No more murders, I hope?""
""Oh no, nothing like that. The fact is, the business is very simple indeed, and I am sure we can manage it ourselves. But I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of the case, because it is so very odd.""
""Simple and odd."" said Dupin.
""Yes, in a way, though not exactly. The fact is, we have all been extremely puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet... we cannot understand it.""

"JAZZ 

By Katie Atkins, aged 14 

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools – and our band won! 
Each band had their own costumes, ranging from black school uniforms like my band wore, to brightly-coloured T-shirts. We didn’t look much like adult professional bands, but all of us were used to performing in competitions, so the quality of playing was amazing, especially considering everyone was so young. Players from each band even created new tunes right there on stage. It was exciting to watch – but even better when my band played on stage! 
We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to play in it gets accepted – only about half, in fact. But anyone who’s keen to play goes to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning its language. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country – I’ve been to a couple and learnt a lot. 
Adults are often surprised that young people are getting interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it’s because pop music isn’t challenging enough for people like me who are serious about music. But I find it exciting because it’s both new and old at the same time – you can create your own music, but you also feel you’re part of its history, as you’re playing on stage in the same way as great jazz performers before you. 
My school’s really lucky because we have great teachers, and parents who’ve supported us all the way. Without them, we’d never get anywhere with our music!",B1,"{'title': '9510ebdc-c0e0-40b4-96fb-94c9f7097c05.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'JAZZ \n\nBy Katie Atkins, aged 14 \n\nI play the trumpet in my school jazz band.

"Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' 
 
The word * money * is one of the most common ones in songs, books, newspapers and every day conversations. Everything that sorrounds us can be * translated * into money, everything has its own price .
A well-known motto says that money does not make happiness, but as we know, it can be useful! Moreover, another statement has to be kept in mind: it is better being in good health than having a lot of money. It is not always true that if you can pay for your treatments you will surely be better, as the touching case of Giovanni Alberto Agnelli has recently shown. Money is undoubtedly the means by which people can grant their own desires. But what are they? A new powerful car, a big house, beautiful clothes, but also other people freedom or institutions. When someone gets used to buy everything this becomes a sort of * illness *. If there is a problem money is the only solution, money becomes the key which opens every door. People pay for being privilegiate, for cancelling accuses, for a better appearance and so on, as famous political men and actors always show .
Money should be used for noble purposes, but, in many cases, this is not true. Everyone thinks at its own pleasures forgetting the rest of the world. So there are case of rich people who pay judges not to be condemned for their crimes and often innocent men or women pay the consequences. Not to speak about moral corruption money can bring. People who can afford every kind of pleasures are never satisfied and want always more; so it is common the use of alcohol and drugs to reach the highest level of emotions. It is a never ending circle which brings to unbelievable facts, like selling everything one person owns or having a great deal of debts .
Another aspect linked to money is the behaviour of people who do not own much money or, worse, who have nothing and live in indigence. Someone tries to improve its state with its own strenghts, other get worst and making money becomes the only reason of their life. So these people start ?bedding? and even stealing. They can eve kill in order to make money. To this trend many offences are connected and it is difficult to say whether illegal acts are due to the need of money or money is so powerful to corrupt human souls .
It is too easy saying that money is the root of evil, it is not always true. Men are often the major causes for evil actions, their aspirations and desires drive them to commit crimes. Money must be taken apart, it is our fault not its. Our nature is too feable to resist to temptations, that is why we hide ourselves behind abstract concepts. Money can be the root either for evil and for good: it is up to us making a choice .",B1,"{'title': '240_ITTO5007.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: In the words of the old song: 'Money is the root of all evil' \n \nThe word * money * is one of the most common ones in songs, books, newspapers and every day conversations.

"Title: Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare students for the real world. They are therefore of very little value. 

Most university degrees are theoretical and do not prepare the students for the real world. The syllabus in the universities are not according to the practical world. They only contain the bookish knowledge. Though the students get the degrees from university yet this degree do not help them to take various steps in the real life and they are unable to solve the various problems in the life .
The degrees are theoretical as they are not directly linked with the real world. If we consider the example of a student of M.S in Physics then his knowledge is theoretical. The books which are related to his degree are theoretical. He can have the knowledge of equations and the various principles such as Newton's law but he is unable to apply his knowledge in the practical world .
Theoretical world is world is not what we study in books but it is full with the worries, fears, fever and dangers. The university degrees only help to get a job or a name in the society. In this way university degrees are only the source of getting fame and earning money . 
What students study at the university is not related to the practical world. For instance a student of biology study only the theories related to the subject and the important works what the scientist have done in this field. Practical world does not demand for such things. In practical world their deeds are different. Sometimes it happens that a student fully wants away from his/her practical life while getting a university degree. And when he attains the degree the has turned into a different way having different social norms. In this way he/she finds a lot of problems to survive in the practical world and to cope with his/her mates .
Sometimes it happens that a topper and gold medalist fails to survive in the practical world. He faces a lot of difficulties in adjusting himself in the society though his degrees are the source to provide him the theoretical knowledge yet his knowledge is of no use in the practical world. As the demands of the practical world are totally different from what a student study in attaining any university degree. In this way the university degrees are of little value the knowledge which does not help in practical world is useless. It only remains the bookish knowledge . 
Sometimes it happen that though the student study related to practical world they only study for the sake of getting good marks in their university degrees. They remain unable to apply their knowledge in the practical to over come the difficulties and to take various steps related to their practical life . 
The university degrees remain of little value because the knowledge is not conveyed in the correct way to the students. The teachers only give lectures and the students only adopt it in a way of solving the question paper not in a way to use these in solving the problems of practical life. In this way can solve the question paper best but the question of the practical life remains unsolved .
To conclude, we can say that the most university degrees are of the little importance as the degrees are unable to provide the students a better understanding of the practical world.

"Living in the valley

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival.
It was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter, even before November was out. Until that time, we had felt safe and sheltered in our valley below the protecting hills.
Soon snow began to fall. Within a day it lay some 15 centimetres deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the streamside path slippery and dangerous. But on the neighbouring heights the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. Up there the wind blasted fiercely. Deep in our valley we felt only sudden gusts of wind; trees swayed but the branches held firm.
And yet we knew that there was reason for us to worry. The snow and wind were certainly inconvenient but they did not really trouble us greatly. It was the river, the Ryburn, which normally flowed so gently, that threatened us most. It reminded us of what could have occurred if circumstances had been different, if the flow of water from the hills had not, many years before, been controlled, held back by a series of dams.
In a short time the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched furious clouds pile up high over the hills to the west. Sinister grey clouds extended over the valleys. They twisted and turned, rising eastwards and upwards, warning of what was to come. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which every day was becoming fuller and wilder.
The snow was gradually washed away as more and more rain streamed from the clouds, but high up in the hills the reservoir was filling and was fast approaching danger level. And then it happened - for the first time in years the reservoir overflowed. There in the heights it was like the Niagara Falls, as the water surged over the edge of the dam and poured into the stream below. 
The river seemed maddened as the waters poured almost horizontally down to its lower stretches. Just a couple of metres from our cottage, the stream seemed wild beneath the bridge. It was far deeper than we'd ever seen it so near our home, lunging furiously at its banks. For three days we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Fortunately, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to subside.
On many occasions through the centuries before the dam was built, the river had flooded the nearby villages in just such a rage. Now, though, the dam restricts the flow of the river and usually all is well; the great mass of water from the hills, the product of snow and torrential rain, remains behind its barrier with just the occasional overflow. We can thus enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley, and can be thrilled by the tremendous power which we know the river possesses. Thanks to this protection we can feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe.",B2,"{'title': '92db8c11-ca48-4387-b341-e9b4c921a46e.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Living in the valley\n\nWe had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realised the dangers that could exist in the surrounding hills and threaten our very survival.\nIt was the year when the storms came early, before the calendar even hinted at winter, even before November was out.

"SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS 

How to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability? It's not always clear how best to develop and encourage their gift. Many parents may even fail to recognise and respond to their child's need until frustration explodes into difficult or uncooperative behaviour. And while most schools are equipped to deal with children who are especially able in academic subjects, the musically gifted require special understanding which may not always be available in an ordinary school - especially one where music is regarded as a secondary activity. Such children - as well as those whose ability is actively encouraged by parents or teachers - may well benefit from the education offered by a specialist music school. 
The five music schools in Britain are a relatively recent introduction. They aim to provide a
sympathetic environment in which gifted children aged between seven and eighteen can develop their skills to the full under the guidance of professional musicians.
Children at specialist music schools spend between one third and one half of an average day on musical activities, for example, individual lessons (up to three hours a week on first and second instruments), orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting and theory. They also spend several hours a day practising in properly equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is taken up with a restricted academic programme, which tends to concentrate on the essential subjects - English, maths, basic sciences and languages - although provision can be made for students who wish to study a wider range of subjects. All five British specialist schools are independent, classes are small by normal school standards, with a high teacher/pupil ratio. Most children attending specialist schools tend to be boarders, leaving home to live, eat and sleep full-time at school. This means they spend their formative years in the company of others with similar aims and interests. 
What are the disadvantages? An obvious problem is the cost; the fees are high (PS12,000-PS17,000 a year for boarders). However, each school will make every effort with scholarships and other forms of financial assistance, to help parents of outstandingly gifted children to find the necessary fees. Secondly, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, specially at a very early age. Almost all the directors of the specialist schools express doubts about the wisdom of admitting children as young as seven into such an intense and disciplined environment. They stress, however, that their main aim is to turn out 'rounded and well-balanced individuals'. 
There is little doubt that setting musically gifted children apart from an early age can cause stress. Early signs of musical ability may disappear in teenage years, while natural competitiveness and the pressure to succeed can lead to a crushing sense of failure. But all specialist schools do keep a close watch on the progress of individual pupils, and offer help and advice if needed.
In addition, while most former pupils at music school feel that they benefited enormously from the range of high-quality music teaching available, many express reservations about the wisdom of restricting the academic programme, which definitely takes second place to musical activities. Many musically gifted young people are also highly intelligent, well able to deal with academic pressure, and feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met. For these reasons, it may be better to wait until the child is old enough to be able to make his or her own decisions before considering a specialist education. 
Those who are equally gifted academically may do very well within a less specialised environment; for instance, at a school with a first class music department, or else by combining a normal school routine with musical training at one of the junior departments at the music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning opportunities for individual lessons with fine teachers, plus orchestral and chamber music experience. But this option is clearly not practicable for families living out of reach of London or other major centres.",B2,"{'title': '50.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS \n\nHow to cope with a child who shows outstanding musical ability?

"Title: How English Should Be Taught 
 
Speaking and listening are important. They are essential in communication. I think that English learning is not only to learn language but also communication. Speaking and listening are the very first step to master English, so we should have more conversation practices in class. I often hear that if we want to improve our English skills as soon as impossible, we should go to America, England, or Australia. In other words, if we listen and speak much as if we live in these countries, I'm sure we can improve English skills. I want to say again, we should have many conversation practices .
When I was junior high or high school student, I didn't speak English so much. Teachers spoke mostly and we students spoke only a little Japanese. I didn't have chances to practice conversations in English only a few times. It was not enough. At college I had ""speaking and listening"" class for the first time and I was requested to speak English during an activity in the class. I had not had conversation practice before, so I was very confused. What did the teacher say? What should I answer the question? Actually, I didn't catch even a very easy sentence, for example, !What did you do yesterday?"" Then, I wondered why I had studied grammar which was not so useful in communication. I always didn't like to study grammar because it was a little difficult to understand. Also, I learned it was not so useful. The fact was irritating for me. I felt I was a student who couldn't keep up with the others and the class level. I lost my motivation to study English. Now I don't feel so. Now I think grammar is also important. But I learned from my experience that if he or she feels what they studied is useless, they will lose their motivations and stop to improve their skills .
We should have many practices of conversation and speeches in earlier education, junior high school. If they are not successful, it is OK! Failures or mistakes are good rather than successes, because we will have many mistakes during communication. Important thing is how we can solve the problems. Failures will lead to successes .
Also, the atmosphere is so quiet in class. It is difficult for students to ask questions or say their opinions in such a quiet place. If they don't speak English, they will never be able to speak it. To say own opinions is very important in American culture. Teacher should tell about it and pay attention to atmosphere of class. English should be taught in cheerful atmosphere and we should have many, many practices of conversations .",B1,"{'title': '254_JPSW3011.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B1+', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: How English Should Be Taught \n \nSpeaking and listening are important.

I always didn\'t like to study grammar because it was a little difficult to understand. Also, I learned it was not so useful. The fact was irritating for me. I felt I was a student who couldn\'t keep up with the others and the class level. I lost my motivation to study English. Now I don\'t feel so. Now I think grammar is also important. But I learned from my experience that if he or she feels what they studied is useless, they will lose their motivations and stop to improve their skills .\nWe should have many practices of conversation and speeches in earlier education, junior high school. If they are not successful, it is OK! Failures or mistakes are good rather than successes, because we will have many mistakes during communication. Important thing is how we can solve the problems. Failures will lead to successes .\nAlso, the atmosphere is so quiet in class. It is difficult for students to ask questions or say their opinions in such a quiet place. If they don\'t speak English, they will never be able to speak it. To say own opinions is very important in American culture. Teacher should tell about it and pay attention to atmosphere of class. English should be taught in cheerful atmosphere and we should have many, many practices of conversations .\n'}"

"Metals

It may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals. Sitting by the side of a river, waiting for a fish to come within a spears throw, or just idling away a moment, one of our early ancestors might have happened upon a shiny yellow pebble and plucked it off the river bed. It did not have the feel of stone, but it was attractive. In such a way, one could conjecture that gold entered the lives of primitive people.
Given the malleability of the metal, it very soon became a much sought-after material. Copper may also have been discovered by accident, and once the value of copper tools was realised, the search for its ores and for ways of getting the copper out of them was pursued with vigour. Thus, metalworking was added to our ancestors’ battery of life-enhancing accomplishments.

St Ives

There was silence as we lugged our bags down the winding, cobbled lane that led to the heart of town, bent double against the force eight gale and trying in vain to avoid the icy waves that smashed over the promenade. There was no one on the streets and the shutters in every cottage on the waterfront were bolted tight against the battering. We had watched the weather worsen as we chugged into St Ives on the tiny single-track railway. As the ominous grey skies closed in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season - without a car - no longer seemed such a good idea. I had lured my friend into joining me with the promise of walks along the beautiful Cornish coast, and snug evenings, toasting ourselves before open fires.

Computer Modelling

The problem with studying the past is that it is past. The people who prospered in times of peace and plenty and struggled through conflict and drought are long dead. The forces that drove them to settle here or move there, that brought them together as families and clans, villages and cities, have faded from memory. Archaeology provides hints and clues, but we cannot test our hypotheses with experiments on cultures living or dead. We cannot rewind the tape and watch a replay of the past. Then again, perhaps we can.
Computer modelling allows us to recreate prehistoric landscapes and environments and populate them with virtual communities - digital creations with some of the needs, independence and capabilities of real-world humans. We can establish rules of conduct and replicate social units. Then we can turn down the rainfall - or turn up the population - and watch how this cyber-culture and its artificial people react.",C2,"{'title': '134c9ca0-6877-47b9-8264-e6fcf245ebf5.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Metals\n\nIt may have been a wish for self-adornment that aroused the interest of Stone Age people in metals.

"Miss Rita Cohen, a tiny, pale-skinned girl who looked half the age of Seymour's daughter, Marie, but claimed to be some six years older, came to his facto1y one day. She was dressed in overalls and ugly big shoes, and a bush of wiry hair framed her pretty face. She was so tiny, so young that he could barely believe that she was at the University of Pennsylvania, doing research into the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
Three or four times a year someone either phoned Seymour or wrote to him to ask permission to see his factory, and occasionally he would assist a student by answering questions over the phone or, if the student struck him as especially serious, by offering a brief tour.
Rita Cohen was nearly as small, he thought, as the children from Marie's third-year class, who'd been brought the 50 kilometres from their rural schoolhouse one day, all those years ago, so that Marie's daddy could show them how he made gloves, show them especially Marie's favourite spot, the laying-off table, where, at the end of the process, the men shaped and pressed each and every glove by pulling it carefully down over steam-heated brass hands. The hands were dangerously hot and they were shiny and they stuck straight up from the table in a row, thin-looking, like hands that had been flattened. As a little girl, Marie was captivated by their strangeness and called them the 'pancake hands'.
He heard Rita asking, 'How many pieces come in a shipment?' 'How many? Between twenty and twenty-five thousand.' She continued taking notes as she asked, 'They come direct to your shipping department?'
He liked finding that she was interested in eve1y last detail. 'They come to the tannery. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material and they make it into the right kind of weather for us to work with. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery right here in town. So did I, for six months, when I started working in the business. Ever been inside a tannery?' 'Not yet.' 'Well, you've got to go to a tannery if you're going to write about leather. I'll set that up for you if you'd like. They're primitive places. The technology has improved things, but what you'll see isn't that different from what you'd have seen hundreds of years ago. Awful work. It's said to be the oldest industry of which remains have been found anywhere. Six-thousand-year-old relics of tanning found somewhere Turkey, I believe. The first clothing was just skins that were tanned by smoking them. I told you it was an interesting subject once you get into it. My father is the leather scholar; he's the one you should be talking to. Start my father off about gloves and he'll talk for two days. That's typical, by the way: glovemen love the trade and everything about it. Tell me, have you ever seen anything being manufactured, Miss Cohen?' 'I can't say I have.' 'Never seen anything made?' 'Saw my mother make a cake when I was a child.'
He laughed. She had made him laugh. An innocent with spirit, eager to learn. His daughter was easily 30 cm taller than Rita Cohen, fair where she was dark, but othenwise Rita Cohen had begun to remind him of Marie. The good-natured intelligence that would just waft out of her and into the house when she came home from school, full of what she'd learned in class. How she remembered everything. Everything neatly taken down in her notebook and memorised overnight.

"Title: Should Mobile Phones Be Prohibited?

The rapid spread of technological devices is one of the greatest problems of our time.
The proper regulations regarding the use of these devices are still lacking. While many such instruments are silent and discreete, mobile phones can be disturbing, indeed. There are restrictions in theatres, cinemas, libraries, etc., however, it is considered to be a problem that many people use their mobile phones on means of public transportation. This problem could be solved, if the use of phones was prohibited on vehicles of public transportation.
As there are people who ignore regulations that are unwritten, these should be created on a legal basis. For this reason, a law should be passed, regulating the use of mobile phones, including and detailing, the restrictions of using mobile phones on means of transportation. Enforcing the regulations should be the common issue of local governments and the companies responsible for maintaining the public transportation systems.
While nearly everyone now owns a mobile phone, there is a large number of people who would renounce their use of these devices during the time spent on means of public transportation. Considering the opinion of both sides, it still remains true that the loud conversations, often related to the private life of the owner of the phone, are disturbing. The other travellers may consider this behaviour uncomfortable, inappropriate, and even uncouth. Meanwhile, it also takes away the privacy of the speaker's life, disclosing information that would not belong to public attention. This may cause psychological problems over a long time.
Besides these nervous problems, it has often been stated that the electromagnetic radiation emitted by devices, such as mobile phones, may have harmful effects on one's health. This concerns the owner of the phone, as well as those in their immediate surroundings. Even though this effect is not proven as fatal as the effect of active and passive smoking, the time available for the research has not been enough for a definite conclusion. The health hazard, however, should not be ignored, and it should be taken into consideration, when making a new regulation.
It can be cited. as a disadvantage that in our information-dependent society the prohibition of the use of mobile phones on means of public transportation will have negative effect on business life. This, however, is an exaggeration. The primary means of information transmission now rely more on local and global computer networks, as these provide users with more possibilities, while keep the level of redundancy and noise as low as possible. The partial prohibition of using mobile phones, while may be uncomfortable, will not cause severe problems.

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 

As political movement feminism began between the late 18th and early 20th century in Europe and in the United States. It was always based on the idea that women must have equal rights and opportunities as men. Several disadvantages and advantages of feministic struggle can be listed .
 One of the main disadvantages of feminism is the fact that it usually has a negative meaning to most people. This is a sequence of the tendency for feminism to occur in waves when each of it represents different kinds of feminists who often disagree among themselves on certain issues. For example, the members of earlier generation are being criticised by the later ones, who claim that there is still too little of attention being paid to women's problems. Consequently, another disadvantage appears as the cause of these disagreements. For instance, feminists of later generation believe that the society is still very patriarchal, and women are oppressed by it. For this reason, their attempt to make women dominate in society cannot lead to equality between the two sexes .
 But I think that there are more advantages that women gained from feminism than disadvantages. First, for women in many countries, the area of politics was forbidden for a long period of time. Until it was an exceptionally male activity, women neither could vote in the elections, nor took their part in ruling the country. As a matter of fact, feminists were the first ice breakers that changed the situation radically. Now women have equal rights as men to control the machinery of government and express their political opinion by voting. Second, notwithstanding sex, everyone today has a right to study and get a desirable profession. For example, feminists have proved that women may also achieve high results in studying science as well in the faculties of arts or women as well as men are good physics, doctors, and even astronauts. Finally, sexism is always a thorny question in feministic discussions because it occurs in different situations of life and causes many problems for women. Trying to get a particular type of job is one of the cases when women may confront with an unfair treatment of them because of their sex. For many years feminists struggled against this kind of phenomenon trying to stop it. Actually, they have already represented noticeable achievements. As a result, in most of well developed countries in Europe and in the United States women have equal opportunities as men to get a job. The great majority of employers organises competitions to choose one of the candidates not according to their sex but according to their skills and experience which is necessary in that job .
 To sum up, no matter what was achieved feminists believe that women are still oppressed in comparison with men, and that their oppression is unjustified. However, their struggle has done more good than harm to the cause of women because the attitude towards women has changed in many positive ways. Nowadays women are treated equally to men in politics, education, and workplace .",B2,"{'title': '295_LTVY3003.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good \n\nAs political movement feminism began between the late 18th and early 20th century in Europe and in the United States.

"DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?

We asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success. Here is what they said.

Publisher A

Reviews are absolutely key for publishers - the first part of the newspaper we turn to. The Book Marketing Council found some years ago that when questioned on why they had bought a particular hook, more people cited reviews than any other prompting influence (advertisements, word of mouth, bookshop display, etc.).
Authors' responses to reviews are slightly different from publishers. Both are devastated by no reviews, but publishers are usually more equable about the had reviews, judging that column inches are what matter and that a combination of denunciation and ecstatic praise can actually create sales as readers decide to judge for themselves.
Publishers probably get the most pleasure from a review which precisely echoes their own response to a book - they are often the first 'reader'.

Publisher B

While publishers and the press fairly obviously have a common interest in the nature of book review pages, one also needs to remember that their requirements substantially differ: a newspaper or magazine needs to provide its readers with appropriately entertaining material; a publishing house wants to see books, preferably its own, reviewed, preferably favourably.
Without any question, book reviewing is 'better' -- more diverse, less elitist -- than 40 years ago, when I began reading review pages. That said, there is still a long-grumbled-about tendency to neglect the book medium read by a majority -- namely paperbacks. The weekly roundups aren't really adequate even if conscientiously done. And even original paperbacks only rarely receive serious coverage.
But publishers shouldn't complain too much. Like readers and writers, they need reviews, which after all are an economical way of getting a book and an author known. There is no question that a lively account of a new book by a trusted name can generate sales even more if there are several of them. Fame is what puts a book into the hands of readers.

Publisher C

Reviews are the oxygen of literary publishing; without them, we would be cut off from an essential life-source. Because the books we publish are generally not by 'brand-name' authors, whose books sell with or without reviews, and because we seldom advertise, we depend on the space given to our books by literary editors.
When the reviews are favourable, of course, they are worth infinitely more than any advertisement. The reader knows that the good review is not influenced by the publisher's marketing budget: it is the voice of reason, and there is no doubt that it helps to sell books. Publishers themselves often claim that they look for size rather than content in reviews.
The actual effect of reviews on sales is the inscrutable heart of the whole business. Good reviews can launch a book and a career and occasionally lift sales into the stratosphere: but never entirely on their own. There has to be some fusion with other elements -- a word-of-mouth network of recommendation, a robust response from the book trade, clever marketing.

Publisher D

The relationship in Britain between publishing and reviewing? I wish I knew! In the United States it's simple: the New York Times can make or break a book with a single review. Here, though, the people in the bookshops often don't appear to take much notice of them.
It sometimes takes 20 years of consistently outstanding reviews for people to start reading a good writer's work. Yet some of the most dismally received books, or books not yet reviewed, are the biggest sellers of all. So it's all very unpredictable, though non-action is less so.
Mind you, non-fiction does allow reviewers to indulge themselves by telling us what they know about the subject of the book under review rather than about the book itself.

Publisher E

Of course, all publishers and all writers dream of long, uniformly laudatory reviews. But do they sell books? I once published a biography. The reviews were everything I could have craved. The book was a flop -- because everyone thought that, by reading the lengthy reviews, they need not buy the book.
Does the name of the reviewer make a difference? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, the public seemed to take note and obey their recommendations. These days, it is as much the choice of an unexpected reviewer, or the sheer power or wit or originality of the review, which urges the prospective buyer into the bookshop.",C1,"{'title': '37.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?\n\nWe asked five leading British publishers about the effect of the reviews of a book on its commercial success.

"Charles Darwin (1809-1882) developed a revolutionary theory of evolution that transformed the way we understand the world and we see ourselves. In On the Origin of Species, published in 1859, Darwin described the process of natural selection. 
The 'fittest' animals or plants - those with the characteristics best suited to their environment - are more likely to survive and reproduce. They pass on these desirable characteristics to their offspring. Gradually those features become more common, causing the species to change over time. If the changes are great enough, they can produce an entirely new species. 
The Descent of Man, published in 1871, suggested that humans descended from apes. When Darwin studied medicine, he witnessed an operation performed on a child without anaesthetic. That made him give up medical studies. 
He then studied theology but, instead of becoming a priest, in 1831 he set off on a five-year scientific expedition around the world. There he collected evidence for his future theory. One of the key arguments for natural selection came from the birds that Darwin collected from the Gal pagos Islands. The birds were clearly the same species but some had large strong beaks for eating nuts while others had long thin beaks for finding worms in the ground. 
Darwin realised that all came from a single ancestor but, as they dispersed to different islands, they had adapted to eat the various foods available. Darwin developed the theory of evolution in the 1830s but he didn't announce it then. He knew his ideas were radical so he delayed publishing the theory for about twenty years while he assembled more evidence.",B2,"{'title': '2231836b-9f5f-4513-bfba-7dc6e40900bd.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Charles Darwin (1809-1882) developed a revolutionary theory of evolution that transformed the way we understand the world and we see ourselves.

"Natural Books
We invited four leading naturalists to tell us about the wildlife classic that has influenced them most.
A
Geoffrey Lean
At least it wasn't hard to choose the author. As an environmental journalist, one advantage of longevity is that I have had the chance to meet some of the giants who pioneered thinking in the field. Of these, none stood, indeed, still stands, taller than a small, frail woman, Barbara Ward. I can't think of anyone else more at the heart of environmental issues in post-war Europe. She has synthesised her experience of various environmental movements into her own compelling philosophy. Unwillingly 'volunteered' to cover the field, I found, as a young journalist, that she, more than anyone, made it all make sense.
Picking the book was much harder. It could have been Only One Earth or Progress for a Small Planet. But despite its title (which sounded old-fashioned, even in 1976), The Home of Man is, to me, Barbara's most important book. Its focus is on the explosive growth of the world's cities, but its canvas is the great themes to which she devoted her life. It is as eloquent and as impassioned a plea as exists for what we would now call 'sustainable human development'. In the hundreds of books I have read since, I have yet to meet its equal.

Linda Bennett
When I open the pages of Signals for Survival by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the long calls of herring gulls, recall the smell of the guano in the hot sun and visualise the general hullabaloo of the colony. This book explains superbly, through words and pictures, the fascinating world of animal communication.
Read Signals for Survival and then watch any gull colony, and the frenzy of activity changes from apparent chaos to a highly efficient social structure. You can see which birds are partners, where the boundaries are and, later on in the season, whole families can be recognised.
A distinguished behaviourist, Niko Tinbergen came from that rare breed of academics who wish to explain their findings to the layperson. His collaboration in this book with one of this century's most talented wildlife artists, Eric Ennion, was inspirational and has produced a book of interest to anyone with a love of wildlife. His spontaneous style of painting came from years of watching and understanding birds. With just a minimal amount of line and colour, he brings to life how one gull is an aggressor, how another shows appeasement. This is the art of a true field naturalist.

Lee Durrell
Most definitely, My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell is the book that has had the greatest influence on my life. Beyond the obvious reason that it ultimately led me to a wonderful husband, and an exciting career in conservation, this extraordinary book once and for all defined my devotion to the natural world.
I was doing research work into animal vocalisations in Madagascar when I first read the book. I had been there two years and was discouraged by the number of setbacks I was encountering but when, at the end of the day, I opened My Family and Other Animals to where I had left off the night before, the world became a brighter place. Animals, people, joy and beauty inextricably woven together - a microcosm of a world worth saving.
Many people say that our species is the worst because of the terrible things we have done to the others. But I like to think back to Gerald as a boy in My Family and Other Animals, looking at the world's inhabitants as a whole, a family whose members, be they good, bad or indifferent, are nevertheless so intertwined as to be inseparable. And that is a concept we all need to grasp.

A copy of The Shell Bird Book, by James Fisher, found its way into my school library shortly after it was first published in 1966. I was drawn to it at once, especially to the 48 colour plates of birds by Eric Ennion, painted, as the jacket puts it, ... with particular skill and charm'. It was those Ennion images which captured my attention.
I already had copies of other bird books and had spent several holidays learning to identify birds. They encouraged me to begin sketching what I saw as an aid to identification. But in The Shell Bird Book there was so much more to feast on. As well as the glorious Ennion paintings, there were chapters on migrants and migration, a review of the history of birds in Britain, and, best of all, a chapter on birds in music, literature and art.
It was the broad span of ornithological information and the exciting images that steered me towards being more of a generalist in my appreciation of birds and the natural world. The book made it clear that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid and as possible as a rational and scientific one. And, as art was a stronger subject for me than maths or physics, I began to see a door opening for me",C1,"{'title': 'fd6c865e-5ce8-444b-b4f8-92dc9a317701.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Natural Books\nWe invited four leading naturalists to tell us about the wildlife classic that has influenced them most.\nA\nGeoffrey Lean\nAt least it wasn't hard to choose the author.

This is the art of a true field naturalist.\nC\nLee Durrell\nMost definitely, My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell is the book that has had the greatest influence on my life. Beyond the obvious reason that it ultimately led me to a wonderful husband, and an exciting career in conservation, this extraordinary book once and for all defined my devotion to the natural world.\nI was doing research work into animal vocalisations in Madagascar when I first read the book. I had been there two years and was discouraged by the number of setbacks I was encountering but when, at the end of the day, I opened My Family and Other Animals to where I had left off the night before, the world became a brighter place. Animals, people, joy and beauty inextricably woven together - a microcosm of a world worth saving.\nMany people say that our species is the worst because of the terrible things we have done to the others. But I like to think back to Gerald as a boy in My Family and Other Animals, looking at the world's inhabitants as a whole, a family whose members, be they good, bad or indifferent, are nevertheless so intertwined as to be inseparable. And that is a concept we all need to grasp.\nD\nBruce Pearson\nA copy of The Shell Bird Book, by James Fisher, found its way into my school library shortly after it was first published in 1966. I was drawn to it at once, especially to the 48 colour plates of birds by Eric Ennion, painted, as the jacket puts it, ... with particular skill and charm'. It was those Ennion images which captured my attention.\nI already had copies of other bird books and had spent several holidays learning to identify birds. They encouraged me to begin sketching what I saw as an aid to identification. But in The Shell Bird Book there was so much more to feast on. As well as the glorious Ennion paintings, there were chapters on migrants and migration, a review of the history of birds in Britain, and, best of all, a chapter on birds in music, literature and art.\nIt was the broad span of ornithological information and the exciting images that steered me towards being more of a generalist in my appreciation of birds and the natural world. The book made it clear that my emotional and creative response to nature was as valid and as possible as a rational and scientific one. And, as art was a stronger subject for me than maths or physics, I began to see a door opening for me\n""}"
"Late that evening, we saw land far out to sea and the ship turned towards it. We were nearing Montgomery's island.
After supper, Montgomery and I stood outside, talking under the stars. I was interested to know more about his animals and his island home. But he seemed uncomfortable with my questions, so I soon changed the subject. We spoke about London, and about science. But as we talked, my questions grew stronger in my mind. Why was a man of science living on an unknown island in the middle of the Pacific? Why was he taking the puma, rabbits and dogs there? And who was that strange man who worked for him?
I heard a noise behind me and turned. Montgomery's dark assistant was standing a few steps from us. He looked quickly towards me. For a second or two, his eyes shone red in the lights of the ship. It frightened me terribly. I thought of the stories that I read as a child, of monsters and strange animals of the night. Then the man looked away, and Montgomery was saying, 'I'm going to bed now. There'll be lots to do in the morning.'
I followed him down the ladder and went to my room. I slept little that night. I was woken many times, both by the noises of the dogs and by my terrible dreams.
Early the next morning, I woke to a new sound. Someone above me was pushing the animal cages across the ship. I climbed the ladder. At the top, six men were carrying the puma in his cage to the side of the ship.

"Citizen Kane

When the film Citizen Kane finally appeared in 1941, despite the brouhaha that attended its release - delayed because of distributor’s fears of the harm William Randolph Hearst, its alleged subject, might do to them - and largely ecstatic reviews, it was not a commercial success. It was television that brought it back to the public consciousness. It is perhaps the one film, above all others, that has inspired people to become film-makers. This is all the more astonishing since it was Orson Welles’s first film. Welles always maintained that its success arose from his having no idea of what he was or wasn’t allowed to do: he just went ahead and did it. But he had an extraordinary team at his disposal, cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and the special-effects wizard Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz hit on the idea of portraying a newspaper magnate who both was and wasn’t Hearst, Welles realised that he had found a perfect vehicle for himself both as director and actor, and seized his chance with the energy of a whirlwind.

Dermot and Carmel

Dermot thought that Carmel was rather odd that morning. Twice he had said that he might be late and not to worry if he dropped into the golf club on the way home. He had to have a natter with someone and that was the best place to have it. Twice she had nodded her head amiably and distantly as if she hadn’t really heard or understood. 
‘Will you be all right? What are you going to do today?’ he had asked.
She had smiled. ‘Funny you should ask that. I was just thinking that I hadn’t anything to do all day so I was going to stroll down town and look at the shops. I was thinking that it was almost a sinful thing, just idling away the day.’
Dermot had smiled back. ‘You’re entitled to enjoy yourself. And as I said, if I”m late I won’t want anything to eat. So don’t go to any trouble.’
‘No, that’s fine.' she said.

Title Race 

Tea boy? Do you mind, I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator
Human nature provides the most divine of comedies. Witness a recent study which has informed the nation that job titles are a prime cause of envy and unrest at work. A survey by a leading firm of recruitment consultants found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees admit that titles create divisions among colleagues.
Most shockingly, the survey found that 70% of office workers would be willing to forgo a pay rise in favour of a more ‘motivational’ or ‘professional’ job title. If our vanity is reaching such proportions that even basic greed is being overwhelmed, we are indeed in dire straits.

As the knight in Chaucer's [Reference] has to discover what women most desire, we could ask ourselves: what does Man most covet? In the light of many episodes in history we could say that greed, the need of possession, gives to many people great impetus in life .
One of the underlying principles in our society, like in many others, is the exchange between individuals. From the beginning human beings have exchanged things they had against what they did not have. In this way the more currency you have, the more likely you are to get all you want, to be in power and have the others under your dependence. Who would not want to have much money, who would not want to make profit? This is in fact the basis of trade. Tradesmen are mainly concerned in increasing their takings, that is why they raise their prices and pay their personnel as cheap as possible. What is the use of traffic in drugs and hold-ups if not to get this means of exchange called money? Money, the magic word .
Any world where all would be free and anybody would be disinterested is pure utopia. Life would yet be so easy if each of us could content oneself with the necessary and was not eager on getting the superfluous. Few people are satisfied with what they have. This justifies naturally the success of all these games where you can win money and, on another level, this is also why we witness so many aggressions, burglaries, traffics, corruptions,... Excess is what harms our society but does the society itself not prompt its citizens to spend much money and even more than they have? All over in the streets advertisements encourage the consumer to buy a beautiful new car, to fly to the tropical islands for the holidays or to have absolutely the latest CD or video player. All seems so easy, if you do not have the money now you may well ask for a bank loan. The average man wonders then why he could not enjoy all these goods too .
Money or any kind of currency is thus a necessary instrument in trade but can it be a valuable argument to wage war on a country or on someone and destroy so many innocent lives? Why did the Americans intervene so quickly in the Gulf War if not because they had interests to protect? This is not of course the main reason but the losses of oil could have been disastrous for the US economy. Why do so many families quarrel when they have to share a legacy if not because one member of the family gets or wants more than the others?
Actually very few people like money for money's sake, most of them are desirous of the luxuriousness it may bring. As long as this does not lead to an obsession, anyone may dream of getting more, but once you are ready to make sacrifices in order to get all you want, there must be something wrong.

"Tom Cruise 

Tom Cruise is one of the most successful actors in cinema history. However, life hasn't always been that easy for him. As a young boy, Tom was shy and had difficulty in finding friends, although he really enjoyed taking part in school plays. 
After he had finished High School, Tom went to New York to look for work. He found employment as a porter, and at the same time he attended drama classes.

"Bill Prince-Smith

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer and a teacher and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes into his office and writes. In the evening, he gives the work to his wife to read. 'She tells me when she doesn't like something,' says Bill. 'My ten grandchildren don't live near here but they also read my stories and say if they are good or bad.' And so Bill has learned what young children want to read.
Bill writes about the life in his village and on the farms near it. His fifth book is his favourite: The Sheepdog is about a farmer and the dog that helps him.
'I have always liked animals,' says Bill, 'and dogs are so clever, they learn very quickly.'
Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The film-makers used the latest computer technology to make people think that the animals are speaking.

Bees may travel as far as seventy-five thousand kilometres and visit over two million flowers to produce just half a kilo of honey. The colour and flavour of honey depend on the type of flower visited. In fact, there are more than three hundred varieties of honey. 
The lighter-coloured ones are generally milder in flavour than darker honey. 
In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food, as sugar was very
rare. Honey was of great value to the ancient Egyptians, who used it as payment. 
Today, honey is produced and eaten in every part of the world. Research suggests that it prevents tiredness and improves athletic performance. However, honey is not just food - it can be taken for sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care 26 A involves products.",B1,"{'title': '30.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'HONEY \n\nHoney is a sweet liquid made by bees.

"AESTHETICS

By one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them. For one reason: these works are products that exist externally and physically. In common conception, the work of art is often identified with the building, book, painting, or statue in its existence apart from human experience. Since the actual work of art is what the product does with and in experience, the result is not favourable to understanding. In addition, the very perfection of some of these products, the prestige they possess because of a long history of unquestioned admiration, creates conventions that get in the way of fresh insight. When an art product once attains classic status, it somehow becomes isolated from the human conditions under which it was brought into being and from the human consequences it engenders in actual life experience.
When artistic objects are separated from both conditions of origin and operation in experience, a wall is built around them that renders almost opaque their general significance, with which aesthetic theory deals. Art is remitted to a separate realm, where it is cut off from that association with the materials and aims of every other form of human effort and achievement. A primary task is thus imposed upon one who undertakes to write upon the philosophy of the fine arts. This task is to restore continuity between the refined and intensified forms of experience that are works of art and the everyday events, doings, and sufferings that are universally recognised to constitute experience. Mountain peaks do not float unsupported, they do not even just rest upon the earth. They are the earth in one of its manifest operations. It is the business of those who are concerned with the theory of the earth, geographers and geologists, to make this fact evident in its various implications. The theorist who would deal philosophically with fine art has a like task to accomplish.
If one is willing to grant this position, even if only by way of temporary experiment, one will see that there follows a conclusion which is at first sight surprising. In order to understand the meaning of artistic products, we have to forget them for a time, to turn aside from them and have recourse to the ordinary forces and conditions of experience that we do not usually regard as aesthetic. We must arrive at the theory of art by means of a detour. For theory is concerned with understanding and insight. It is, of course, quite possible to enjoy flowers in their coloured form and delicate fragrance without knowing anything about plants theoretically. But if one sets out to understand the flowering of plants, one is committed to finding out something about the interactions of soil, air, water and sunlight that condition the growth of plants. 
In order to understand the aesthetic in its ultimate and approved forms, one must begin with it in the raw, in the events and scenes that hold the attentive eye and ear, arousing one's interest and affording enjoyment as one looks and listens. Yet so extensive and subtly pervasive are the ideas that set art itself upon a remote pedestal that many people would be repelled rather than pleased if told that they enjoyed their casual recreations, in part at least, because of their aesthetic quality.The arts which today have most vitality for the average person are things he or she does not take to be arts: for instance, the movies, jazz, comic strips, and, too frequently, lurid newspaper accounts of the week's events. For, when what they know as art is relegated to the museum and gallery, the unconquerable impulse towards experiences enjoyable in themselves finds such outlet as the daily environment provides. Many people who protest against the museum conception of art still share the fallacy from which that conception springs. For the popular notion comes from a separation of art from the objects and scenes of ordinary experience that many theorists and critics pride themselves upon holding and even elaborating. The times when select and distinguished objects are closely connected with the products of usual vocations are the times when appreciation of the former is most rife and most keen.",C2,"{'title': '68834f1d-35ba-45cc-94a4-012cbcc899fb.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""AESTHETICS\n\nBy one of the ironic perversities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence of the works of art upon which formation of aesthetic theory depends has become an obstruction to theory about them.

"Gary and Me

The restaurant owner John Moore writes about his relationship with his son Gary, the famous TV chef.
I believe everyone's given a chance in life. My son, Gary, was given his chance with cooking, and my chance was to run a restaurant. When I heard about the opportunity, I rushed over to look at the place. It was in a really bad state. It was perfect for what I had in mind.
Coming into this business made me recall my childhood. I can remember my mother going out to work in a factory and me being so upset because I was left alone. With that in mind, I thought, 'We want time for family life.' My wife dedicated herself to looking after the children and did all my accounts, while I ran the business. We lived over the restaurant in those days, and we always put a lot of emphasis on having meals together. It's paid dividends with our children, Gary and Joe. They're both very confident. Also, from a very early age they would come down and talk to our regular customers. It's given both of them a great start in life.
Gary was quite a lively child when he was really small. We had a corner bath, and when he was about seven he thought he'd jump into it like a swimming pool, and he knocked himself out. When he was older he had to work for pocket money. He started off doing odd jobs and by the age of about ten he was in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had loads of money at school. He had discipline. He used to be up even before me in the morning. If you run a family business, it's for the family, and it was nice to see him helping out.
Gary wasn't very academic, but he shone so much in the kitchen. By the age of 15 he was as good as any of the men working there, and sometimes he was even left in charge. He would produce over a hundred meals, and from then I knew he'd go into catering because he had that flair. So when he came to me and said, 'Dad, I've got to do work experience as part of my course at school,' I sent him to a friend of mine who's got a restaurant.
Gary recently took up playing the drums and now he has his own band. Goodness knows what will happen to the cooking if the music takes off. My advice to Gary would be: if you start chasing two hares, you end up catching neither, so chase the hare you know you're going to catch. He understood when I said to him: 'Gary, if you're going to get anywhere in life, you've got to do it by the age of 30. If you haven't done it by then, it's too late.'
Gary went to catering college at the age of 17, and on his first day he and the other new students -they're normally complete beginners - were given what's supposed to be a morning's work. But within an hour Gary had chopped all his vegetables, sliced all his meats. He'd prepared everything. That's my son for you! In the end, he was helping other people out.
None of us can believe how successful Gary's TV cookery series has become. I'm extremely proud of him. I've always tried to tell him that if you want something, you've got to work jolly hard for it, because no one gives you anything. He's seen the opportunity he's been given and grabbed hold of it with both hands. You know, you talk to your children as they grow up, and if they only take in ten per cent of what you've told them, you've got to be happy with that. The things Gary says, the things he does, I think, well, he must have listened sometimes.",B2,"{'title': '2d9a0ca7-82f9-4b58-ae8a-a707bd1cc2f7.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Gary and Me\n\nThe restaurant owner John Moore writes about his relationship with his son Gary, the famous TV chef.\nI believe everyone's given a chance in life.

"Claire sat down in a chair. Then she saw something in the corner of the room. 'You've got a Christmas tree!' Aunt Min smiled. 'The day after tomorrow is Christmas Day, remember,' she said. 'I brought it in from the garden and put it up when you went for your walk. Do you like it?'

"Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television 
 
Recently, a research about the television was done in the United States of America. It discovered that most of people spend hours of their lives watching television. Men watch television about forty hours a week and women about twenty. It means that men watch television almost six hours a day and women more than two hours . 
People, around the world, need the television, and if they need even a little bit of this every day, they are dependents. It became a ""drug"" in their lives and it's gonna be proved here. The television is accompanying the people's way of life since its invention (1928). 
When the industry of ""media"" discovered the power of this means of communication, it began to use the television to rebuild people's way of thinking, creating shows, soup operas, novels, movies, etc. and commercials in-between that have told watchers what to do, what to wear, and who to be ever since . 
The more the television became fashion the more people went to the market to purchase the way of life it preaches. But the sad part of this is that people have done so, more and more unconsciously . 
Nowadays the TV has became inseparable part of our lives, and generation after generation has born in the TV era, thus we no longer judge its use anymore, although we should, especially for our children. We have grown up taught by the TV set and we have never stopped just a bit to think if these things showed off in TV are respectable and decent to help building our children's personality . 
Most of these children of yesterday are us today, and the reader shall agree with this: that nobody notices how much TV is inserted in this society context, and it appears like a conjunctive tissue to fill the holes of the main tissue of our lifetimes, and, as it was told here in the beginning, alarming amounts of time have been spent in front of the TV set, therefore, two important things have emerged from this: the former is that our way of life hasn't been doing so fine, the major part of our society, the masses, has been put into forced laziness situations (unemployment, poverty, general discouragement) that end up substituted by something; and the latter is that all the things one uses tp skip from these ""forced situations"" (not to face life) are called drugs, and TV watching fits it. So, the television's become a drug; an opium of masses that dopes everybody to have not to face the reality, while it recreates an ""would-be reality"" to please the watcher. When the watcher is already addicted it starts to suck him/her, inducting her/him to spend money, time, space of his/her life...! It can be qualified as a very powerful and hazardous drug, but nobody realizes it! The worst drug is the one that is used and present without revealing its real identity. Let's see the drinking, for instance, even everybody knows it is addictive, it conquered a certain acceptance and tolerance even by the law, so it's found all around normally. The TV is much worse, because the society doesn't even calls it a drug, perhaps because it's been suiting all of its purposes . 
So, meanwhile the television keeps destroying whole homes by ""re-formatting"" the time which people should get together into a lazy seat on the sofa, with no talking not to interfere with the ""video-dialogue"", we may let here a question in the air: wouldn't these sexual and violent behaviour of our youth nowadays a consequence of letting our children be taught by TV instead of us?",B2,"{'title': '027_BRMG1295.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Marx once said that religion was the opium of the masses. If he was alive at the beginning of the 21st century, he would replace religion with television \n \nRecently, a research about the television was done in the United States of America.

It means that men watch television almost six hours a day and women more than two hours . \nPeople, around the world, need the television, and if they need even a little bit of this every day, they are dependents. It became a ""drug"" in their lives and it\'s gonna be proved here. The television is accompanying the people\'s way of life since its invention (1928). \nWhen the industry of ""media"" discovered the power of this means of communication, it began to use the television to rebuild people\'s way of thinking, creating shows, soup operas, novels, movies, etc. and commercials in-between that have told watchers what to do, what to wear, and who to be ever since . \nThe more the television became fashion the more people went to the market to purchase the way of life it preaches.

"Title: Some people say that in our modern world, dominated by science, technology and industrialisation, there is no longer a place for dreaming and imagination. What is your opinion? 

This is a strange comment that in our this modern world which is called global village, and which is dominated by science and technology in all the fields of life, there is no longer a place of dreaming and imagination. Some of the people may agree while some may disagree. Every body has his own point of view. One is thing is evidence that the world has become a global village. And in this global village the science and technology has reached to a very much highest level. Man can not imagine the level where the science has reached. It has reached to a very high climax. Even the science has made true all the dreams of the man that were once only considered dreams. Now all dreams have come true and all imaginations has turned into realities. Once man dreamed to fly in the air and now the aeroplanes have made this dream come true and now man is flying in the air round the clock as much high as much he wants to fly. Once it was a dream to see the man from distance and to hear the other man from distance. But now the mobile phones and televisions have made this dream come true and real. Now the distance is no more a hurdle in the communication. Now man can easily talk to his friends or relatives who are thousand miles away from him on the other side of the globe. Now a few clicks of the buttons bring you in contact with some one who is millions of miles away from you, and you all do it without any wires, without any cables or without any physical link. It shows that how the modern man and the modern world has made progress. It shows that in the global village nothing is impossible. Rather all is possible. And no wish can be left unfulfilled . 
But imagination and dreaming is an important part and parcel of human nature. Man can not live without dreams and imagination. It is the quality of human beings that he dreams of many things. He dreams of things he wants to achieve and he dreams of the things he doest not achieve or he failed to achieve. The dreams and imagination takes him to another world of escapism where he takes refuge in the laps of fascination. The dreaming and imagination are important part of life and they help a lot to spend a normal life on the earth. And other than the escapism, there is another factor which is proof that the imagination and dreaming are necessary for the life. For all major inventions the man first dreamed and then he started working on the dreams and imaginations to make it realize the true. In other words one can say that it was the dreaming and fascination and imagination that lead the man to the path of so many marvellous inventions of age. The flying was a dream of man since so long which came true with the passage of time. So if the process of dreaming is stopped, if it is excluded from the world, there would be no proper life . 
The modern man is too much occupied in the rat race of materialism. The lust for money is too strong in him. All the time man is busy in collecting the wealth and money. He is too much preoccupied in the pursuits of collecting money. So in such a case the man some times take help from his imagination and he falls deep in to the valley of imaginative things which give him relaxation for some time. In this way it is the imagination which helps the modern man to find some moments of relaxation, peace, calm and satisfaction. Similarly, the literature is most of the time based or depending on the imagination. So it is crystal clear that imagination and fascination and dreaming can not be left. One type of dreaming is day dreaming. This is the thing which could not be allowed there in the modern world or one may say that this is the thing which has no place in the modern era.

"Title: Mobile communication - 'connecting people'?

Nowadays hi-tech gadgets aiming at better communication and more intense interpersonal relations abound around us. One is apparently available whenever, wherever he may be. However, by peeping under this perfect image on the surface, one might find that the fine-sounding initiatives have backfired. In my opinion, the worldwide spread of mobile communication devices did not only result in positive effects but also in extremely impersonal communicative methods and in splintering sociability.
First and foremost, the impersonality of the most popular electronic communication tools hinders the basically personal aspect of this process. It is most visible in the case of text messages and e-mails, where only digital signs and small machines convey the information. This apparent distance allows us to express ourselves more freely, neglecting the usual codes of conduct, in terms of communicative methods. That is the reason why we appear to be ruder due to these technological advances. Letters written by hand still involve personal involvement, therefore the aforementioned distance does not have such grave effects . 
Besides these written forms, the seemingly interactive phonecalls lack important features of one-on-one conversations, including the use of the devices of non-verbal communication. The ever widening range of emoticons attempts to compensate for this deficiency in the case of e-mails and text messages. Though phonecalls provide the vocal tools of non-verbal communication, the lack of visual and gesture-involving ones often nears the efficiency of these conversations. It is for these reasons that I consider modern communication devices impersonal, thus inappropriate for their aims.
Apart from the impersonal trait, the mobile devices often distort the existing social relations of the individual. Instead of concentrating on the events ' here and now', many indulge in the relations distant maintained via e-mail or mobile phone. Interrupting an on-going conversation thanks to a call or the arrival of a message is a familiar scene to all of us. As for me, I often find myself in front of the computer (where time seems to fly) typing a mail for hours, while I could spend my precious time for more ' live ' communications, too, for example talking to my family with whom it would be more important and nonetheless, more easy. This feature of focusing on ' there and then ' instead of the current situation is also a disadvantage of the theoretically sociable process of mobile communication.
However, many argue that the advantages of cell phones and widespread Internet use outnumber the disadvantages. They claim that immediate and constant access of people made life easier in problem-solving and that detached relatives and friends can bridge the geographical gap almost entirely. Though their point is reasonable in some special cases, in my point of view the ' intimate zone ' of the individual, and his right to be alone and ' unavailable ' is infringed this way.
As it has been mentioned, the technological advances in the field of mobile communication has resulted in positive effects, in many aspects. Nevertheless, I beleive that the principal aim (as it is included in a slogen of a cell phone manufacturer) to connect people is not achieved completely, since the use of mobile communication devices encourages impersonal communication and a neglect of living, existing personal relations.",C2,"{'title': '205_HUEL4140.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': ""Title: Mobile communication - 'connecting people'?\n\nNowadays hi-tech gadgets aiming at better communication and more intense interpersonal relations abound around us. One is apparently available whenever, wherever he may be. However, by peeping under this perfect image on the surface, one might find that the fine-sounding initiatives have backfired. In my opinion, the worldwide spread of mobile communication devices did not only result in positive effects but also in extremely impersonal communicative methods and in splintering sociability.\nFirst and foremost, the impersonality of the most popular electronic communication tools hinders the basically personal aspect of this process. It is most visible in the case of text messages and e-mails, where only digital signs and small machines convey the information. This apparent distance allows us to express ourselves more freely, neglecting the usual codes of conduct, in terms of communicative methods. That is the reason why we appear to be ruder due to these technological advances. Letters written by hand still involve personal involvement, therefore the aforementioned distance does not have such grave effects . \nBesides these written forms, the seemingly interactive phonecalls lack important features of one-on-one conversations, including the use of the devices of non-verbal communication. The ever widening range of emoticons attempts to compensate for this deficiency in the case of e-mails and text messages. Though phonecalls provide the vocal tools of non-verbal communication, the lack of visual and gesture-involving ones often nears the efficiency of these conversations. It is for these reasons that I consider modern communication devices impersonal, thus inappropriate for their aims.\nApart from the impersonal trait, the mobile devices often distort the existing social relations of the individual.

"‘Does Magna Carta mean nothing to you? Did she die in vain?’ — so joked comedian Tony Hancock (1924-68) in Hancock’s Half Hour back in the 1950s. A light-hearted query, of course, but as we ready ourselves for Magna Carta’s 800th anniversary celebrations in June 2015 it is worth revisiting how relevant the ‘Great Charter’ still is.
On the one hand, for many, Magna Carta is alive and well. It remains a bedrock of Britishness; the foundation of all that’s good about laws and liberties from Land’s End to John O’Groats. The alternative view is that Magna Carta has been reduced to nothing but a symbol; a crumbling relic, redundant at law and in practice.
As always, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle.
There’s rather more nuance to the document than you might think. The 1215 original, which didn’t even bear the famous title at first, was swiftly scrapped by the Pope, as it had been dragged from ‘Bad King John’ under duress. Its beneficiaries were not oppressed serfs (who largely remained in slavery) but Anglo-Norman barons (themselves responsible for much of the oppressing) desperate to curb the monarch’s excesses. And Magna Carta embodied neither jury trial nor habeas corpus — both came later and over time. In reality, much of its text was pretty obscure and administrative — and, frankly, rather dull.
That said, clauses 39 and 40 — and their talk of free men, lawful judgment and justice — retain ‘the power to make the blood race’, to echo Lord Bingham (1933-2010). In the United States of America, Magna Carta informed both the Declaration of Independence and Constitution and is held in almost legendary esteem. However, its authority and influence may derive more from what people think it said, rather than that which it actually contained.",B2,"{'title': 'text_246.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2+', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': '‘Does Magna Carta mean nothing to you?

"Checking accounts, like savings accounts, are part of an individual’s personal money management system. Checking accounts are very similar to savings accounts. Both types of accounts keep your money safe, and both are very easy to access if you need cash. 
Checking accounts are designed to be day-in and day-out money-management tools, while savings accounts are designed for long-term money-management. Unlike savings accounts, banks expect people to make frequent withdrawals and deposits to checking accounts. 
An important difference between checking and savings accounts is that checking accounts come with checks! 
A second important difference is that most savings accounts earn interest, while many checking accounts do not. 
Checks can be used to make purchases, just like cash, and they help people pay bills or make simple purchases without carrying around cash or sending it through the mail. People use checks for rent, groceries, clothes. 
Checks are legal documents that function like cash. Knowing how to write a check correctly is fundamental to good money management. 
It’s important for students to understand that in order to write a check, there must be sufficient funds in the checking account to cover the amount. Writing a check when you know there is not enough money in the account to cover it is a violation of the law.

"Photographing People

People are the most interesting of all subjects. A photograph with someone in it is almost always more compelling than the same shot without the human interest. People are also the most difficult subjects to photograph well. Apart from the technical and artistic considerations, the photographer has to be conscious of actions, gestures and expressions. And often the presence of the camera itself can have a disastrous effect on these.

A. GROUPING PEOPLE

Avoid straight lines in group shots. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances and if possible on different levels. Otherwise, have some of the group sitting or kneeling at the front so that you can see all the faces, or raise your own viewpoint.

B. POSING FOR PICTURES

People seldom act naturally in front of the camera. Often they stiffen up and the pose becomes rather wooden. Relax your subject by helping him to find a comfortable position. You might suggest he folds his hands or puts them in his pockets.

C. THE RIGHT APPROACH

Never try to pretend that you are not taking a picture of someone when it is clear that you are as this only creates tension and even hostility. Most people will agree to have their picture taken - perhaps after some initial protestations - and are quite flattered by it. But they are likely to become rather self-conscious and you may need to direct them. A picture can be spoiled by the fact that the subject is looking rather aimlessly out of the picture so that the interest lies elsewhere.

D. EYE CONTACT

A picture gains immediate impact if the subject appears to be looking at the viewer of the picture. Ask your subject to look into the lens - not necessarily to smile as well — and this is the effect you will get. The subject may not be able to do this for too long: he may become self-conscious or be distracted by someone nearby. So remind him once more, just before you release the shutter. Or try saying something funny or unexpected as you take the shot for a genuine reaction rather than a meaningless stare.

E. CANDID CONCENTRATION

An alternative to direct eye contact is for the subject to concentrate on something within the picture area. Your subject might find this easier to do, and the viewer can follow the attention to another part of the picture. You get the impression that you are observing the subject unnoticed. Candid shots have a special fascination and the subject’s expression is vital to the picture.

F. EXPRESSIONS AND GESTURES

Expressions and the gestures that go with them tell us more about the subject of a photograph than anything else. Even if he is obviously badly treated and hungry, a laughing child provokes a smile from the viewer, whereas a sad expression produces a sympathetic sadness in the viewer, however apparently comfortable the subject may be. Look for familiar expressions for your portraits: shrugs, winks, anger, tears, thumbs-up, fist-clenching and so on. They are an instant visual language.

G. SITUATION INTEREST

Though shots which isolate a figure or face prominently have great impact, the subject's background or environment can add extra interest and information about the subject. When using a background in this way, try to exclude details that are not relevant to the subject or blur them by focusing selectively. Make sure that the subject is not overwhelmed by the background - a wide-angle lens will make your subject appear relatively larger by comparison with the background.

H. INTERACTION

Wherever two or more people are talking, arguing, haggling, joking or working together, there are opportunities for good pictures. Couples make appealing shots; so do mothers and babies, teachers and children or teams of people working or playing a sport. Look out especially for contact between the subjects - either eye-contact or physical contact, like a protective hand on the arm or a handshake. Or show how one is reacting to another by waiting for an animated expression or telling gesture.

I. PEOPLE AND PLACES

Many pictures of people are taken on holiday or during an outing - partly to show the place they were visiting. A little care will greatly improve this type of picture. To show people against a relevant background, use a standard or a wide-angle lens and move far enough back to get the whole building (or mountain, or lake) in the frame. Ask your subjects to come fairly close to the camera and compose the picture so that the group forms a foreground interest without obscuring the background. If you can find a slightly elevated camera position, this will be far easier to do. A good picture will show a balance between the subjects and the place they were visiting, so that both claim an equal share of the viewer's attention.

J. TO POSE OR NOT TO POSE?

In answer to this question, first decide why you want to take the picture. If you are taking a picture to remember someone by someone you may have met briefly on holiday, for example - then you will want a good clear picture and it would be worth asking the subject to pose against a well-chosen background. Pictures of the family, on the other hand, can be very tedious if they are a succession of formal poses in front of places of interest. Candid pictures of events as they happen are far more lively, and you are more likely to get unselfconscious shots when you know the subject well. A picture taken on the spur of the moment will jog the family memory in future years far better than a posed portrait.",C1,"{'title': '739e55e2-3fd0-4b28-b70b-d11df26811dc.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Photographing People\n\nPeople are the most interesting of all subjects.

"Title: Discuss the view that capital punishment should be carried out in all cases for murder. 
 
As you know, thousands of people would lose their lives everyday for lots of different reasons. Some are die of disease, some are die of the old age. Some are die from traffic accident, some are murdered, and so on .
However, we can avoid so many person lose their lives. Reasons of disease, accident and age that are can't control but we can stop the murder cases raising. We can protect the right of life. We can also forbidden the unfair matters happen by rules .
Even though, in the society, there are still so many reasons that make someone to kill a person. Take money for example, someone will lose himself, will lose the humanity, just in order to get more money. They just think about themselves, they just want to enjoy the life without any effort, they just want to get but giving. In a word, they are selfish. They are harmful to every member of society. Once they are arrested, they will be capital punished. That's no doubt. And no one will feel pity about that. People even will say that, "" That's the result they ask for.""
Besides the money, under the seduction of the power, murder becomes more and more common between two different governments or two organizations. In some foreign countries, many political leaders were murdered, just because their political opinions go against their own. Here, we can't tell which side is right or which side is wrong, but we are sure that, "" To kill a person or more just in order to build a new peace government, just in order to bring the fortune to people, all of these is not humane. It is even an excuse to clear the way for his own benefit. This case is also unacceptable. What's worst, this kind of case usually is abused by the whole world .
However, there is another kind of murder, which still needs discussion for the punishment. Why does it need discussion though it is illegal? Here, I will show the background to you. A cadre oppress the people with his power, and get much extra money from the people, who make the people live under a terrible sutuation. The people do nothing to him though they hate him very much. As days past by, this ill-treat makes people feel terrible. Finally, someone can't stand for him any longer and kill him. Well, he did a good job for people. And he would be praised by the people. But, from another point of view, he breaks the role, his behavior is illegal, he should be punished by the judge. In fact, the dead man is really not a good cadre, but maybe is a good husband or a good father. As his death, his families may go crazy, and couldn't live on normally. In another word, the murderer also did harm to people. Why do the people will agree to kill the cadre? Why do they will surport the murderer? That's because these people don't know much about the rules, and they don't know how to use the rules to protect themselves until they can't turn back .
According to this example, we can see that no matter for what reason, once you break the rule, you must be punished. If not, this world will become disorder, the life will be at danger all the time, the whole human being will stop developing. At least, human being will die out from the world. From that case, we also found a serous problem, that is, "" so many people are lack of knowledge about rules."" I think, that's the reason why so many people break the rules .
So, in order to keep the world peace, we must learn the rule and we must use the rule to protect ourselves.

If not, this world will become disorder, the life will be at danger all the time, the whole human being will stop developing. At least, human being will die out from the world. From that case, we also found a serous problem, that is, "" so many people are lack of knowledge about rules."" I think, that\'s the reason why so many people break the rules .\nSo, in order to keep the world peace, we must learn the rule and we must use the rule to protect ourselves. Besides, we insist that we will go on to punish the murder strictly no matter for what reason they kill a person .\n'}"

"Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good 
 
It has usually been said that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good. This may be true, but had it been ever thought the reasons of this assertion? First, I would like to make a distinction between the concepts of ""liberated woman"" and ""feminist"": The former is the woman who has realized of her condition in this world and tries to improve it without wanting to replace men, whereas the latter is more radical and wants to replace men .
Men had always been considered as the only one source of income and, therefore, of some stability in the family. This comes from the early times of the Humankind in the world and the constitution of the family. Since men were much stronger than women, they were suposed to be hunters for the group, whereas women were suposed to take care of the family, to take care of the ""home fire"".
It is very difficult to have the certain knowledge about how their feelings were developped and how all these feelings became what they were centuries ago and they are nowadays. We can see it in the language. The human beings have always felt the necessity of talking to others, which was stronger when they started to hunt. Language evolved very quickly, then. However, we cannot think that language evolved in the same way for men and women, as men must use a certain type of vocabulary related to hunt and animals, whereas women's vocabulary related to home, fire, etc .
Jointly with the question of language, a certain personality was developped, too. Thus, women were less socialbe than men were because they didn't need to communicate themselves outside their homes as much as their partners. So, from those times up to very recent times (we must remember the Middle Ages), women have been suposed to be silent, discreet and friendly:silent and discreet because it wasn't considered as well that a woman spoke and told great things about philosophy, etc.; friendly with the men, above all. It is a very complicate way of feeling. They must think that a friendly, complaissant woman gave them the rest they need: when the hunter came back to his cavern, he, a primitive man, would find a sort of real rest and home into this cavern, beside the less sociable, with a worse easiness to communicate woman and then, they got used to it, making an idealization of their partners .
The problem was that later women became sociable than before; this silent and prudence was beginning to disappear as well as men's structures. Woman have always had a very difficult access to the world of knowledge. The ones who wanted to investigate and become doctors were called witches; a woman writer is very difficult to find until the XVIII and XIX centuries. She couldn't say what she tought in public: a woman had to be silent. Men evolved, but they kept with themselves this idealization as a rest of their old work as hunters and family supporters. However, this work is not so old: they still were the strongest; the only ones who could work and say great things were them. Fortunately, the world has being continually changing, and nowadays we cannot think of such conditions of life for women, although there is still a rest of all this in our present world .
As the world was changing and women were feeling the necessity of communicate themselves, basicly in order to improve their life conditions, they had to use another language and therefore, change the structures long-time stablished. This was considered a man's work. We must remember the ""fin ' amor"", in which man had to challenge the marriage structure; later, it became a structure in the Middle Ages .
Unfortunately, not only men had this structure: women had it, too. The mothers or grandmothers tried to make young girls follow it. So liberated woman had a double work to do:fight against men and fight against other woman carried it, too and try to make them realize of their bad situation. And because it was not an easy task for them to do, they had to persist very much in their aim. So the adoption of a language and behaviour strange in the female sex and the perseverance which they carried it with, had the whole world to marginalize them. Yet, the world got nothing because women continued defending their ideas. They often had to do it very hard against other human beings. This led some women to want to be in the places occupied by man, firstly, Men's ""ego"" got very hurt and so this prevailed until right now .",B2,"{'title': '433_SPM04003.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'icle500', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'learner', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC0 1.0 (Public Domain)', 'text': 'Title: Feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good \n \nIt has usually been said that feminists have done more harm to the cause of women than good.

Infact the world of Scince technology and in dustrialisation help the main concept of the dreaming and the imagining world in abig way I'll give you an example, 30 years ago people wouldn't dream of communicating globaly with their counterpart from anywhere in the world. But thanks to the dreaming of people like Bill Gates who dreamnt of one day owning his own software / Computer Company which today is possible for us to communicate via E-mail of his computers .
We can travel anywhere in the world because have airplanes thanks to some one whoinitialy had a concept in his mind that one day he want to Create an airplane in order to assist people to travel anywhere in the world. So we can say that thinking and imagining is part of Scince and techology .
They go hand in hand in order for thinks that are good for industries to be established so that we can live better as people is this world .
I mean even Cellphones, telephones they were created by people out of their imagination before they were established physically.

"Interview Tips

First impressions are often lasting ones. Studies show that people form impressions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They observe how we dress, our eye contact, our body movement and how fast or slowly we talk, our volume and tone of voice as well as our our actual words.
Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She says, 'I worked hard to earn my degree. When I finally graduated I was very confident.' She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher.'I noticed a small hole in my jacket that morning,' she recalls. 'I would have changed, but I knew it would make me late, and I always think it's important to be on time.' Mary didn't get the job. In fact, one of her friends who also teaches at the school told her the Head Teacher's only comment was, 'If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher is she going to be?' 
As Simon Grant, hotel manager, says: 'Interviewees who look as if they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think it's
what's inside that counts, but in an interview you should aim to come across in the best possible way.'
Yet many people ignore the importance of having a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for
the position but wasn't even given an interview. 'I thought it was a mistake so I asked the Director of Personnel what had happened,' she says. 'He told me I didn't fit the image of an office manager. He suggested I improve my wardrobe before I applied again for promotion. I was shocked. I do a very good job and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.' 
Movement and gestures will also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message. So make sure your words agree with your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer. 
It is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. 'I was delighted,' she recalls. 'But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.' 
Finally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to inform yourself about the company before you go for an interview. 'The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company.' 
Businessconsultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, 'Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points.'",B2,"{'title': '56.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'cambridge-exams', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'B2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Interview Tips\n\nFirst impressions are often lasting ones.

I do a very good job and the way I dress shouldn't make any difference.' \nMovement and gestures will also influence an interviewer's first impression of a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian has discovered that 7% of any message about our feelings and attitudes comes from the words we use, 38% from voice and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and our words send different messages the listener will put more weight on the non-verbal message. So make sure your words agree with your body language. Mixed messages will only confuse the interviewer. \nIt is also important not to appear too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion her interview went so well she was offered the job on the spot. 'I was delighted,' she recalls. 'But I reacted to the offer with too much enthusiasm. Once the boss sensed how excited I was, he knew I wasn't going to turn him down. Consequently, he offered me a lower salary than I'd hoped for. I'm sure I could have got more had I managed to control my excitement.' \nFinally, a consideration of what we say and how we say it will contribute to the success of an interview. David Artesio, the manager of an employment agency, suggests that it's a good idea to inform yourself about the company before you go for an interview. 'The annual report, for example, will tell you about areas of company involvement. Mention an area that interests you during the interview. This will give a positive note and convince others of your interest in the company.' \nBusinessconsultant Marian Woodall suggests you have a few questions ready and avoid speaking in long, confused sentences. As she puts it, 'Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and even in highlighted points.' ""}"

"Holiday reading

Summer promises us two of life’s great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are, of course, intimately connected. Books may help us to feel more at home in the world at large. We can relate our experiences to those described in great books written long ago or in distant lands because there are fewer human types than there are people. In the books of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments and dramas. Authors can locate words to depict a situation we thought ourselves alone in feeling, or can express our very own thoughts, but with a clarity and psychological accuracy we could not match. What was shy and confused within us is unapologetically and cogently phrased in them, a congruence all the more striking if the work was written by someone in a far-flung place or in another age. We feel grateful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and travel, we escape the deadening effect of habit. Our eyes are never more open than during our first few days in a new place: except perhaps during our reading of a great book, which guides us to the interest of things we had previously ignored. Our mind is like a radar newly attuned to pick up certain objects floating through consciousness. Our attention is drawn to the shades of the sky, to the changeability of a face, to the hypocrisy of a friend, or to a submerged sadness about a situation that we had previously not even known we could feel sad about. 

Author’s Note

These travel reflections were all published as articles in the Observer newspaper over a seven-year period. Here and there I have restored some small cuts by the editor, which had to be made if the piece was to fit the page, but otherwise I have added very little. The occasional outright howler has been corrected, but only if it was a matter of detail which I should have got right in the first place. Hindsight would have allowed further improvements, but there would have been no end to the process. In the second article about China, for example, it seemed likely at the time, and for some time after, that the Hong Kong dollar would hold up. A year later it fell. If I were to rewrite the piece so as to predict this fact, it would become a claim to prescience, or at any rate no longer a report written at that moment. But like any other flying visitor, in South East Asia or anywhere else, I was there at that moment, ignorant as to what would happen next, and fully occupied with making the most elementary sense of what had happened already. That has been the real story of mass jet travel: the world opening up to people who have no qualifications for exploring it except the price of a ticket. But I have never been able to believe that all my fellow travellers were quite blind. Even a postcard can be written with a purpose.

Ecotourism

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been hijacked, diluted and misused, then ‘ecotourism’ would earn top prize. The term first surfaced in the early 1980s, reflecting a surge in environmental awareness and a realisation by tour operators that many travellers wanted to believe their presence abroad would not have a negative impact. It rapidly became the hottest marketing tag a holiday could carry.
These days the ecotourism label has broadened out to cover anything from a two-week tour living with remote tribes, to a one-hour motor boat trip through an Australian gorge. In fact, any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty spots, wildlife or a dash of soft adventure is likely to be included in the overflowing ecotourism folder. There is no doubt the original motives behind the movement were honourable attempts to provide a way for those who cared to make informed choices, but the lack of regulations and a standard industry definition left many travellers lost in an ecotourism jungle.

Transylvanian Journey

The notebook covering the Transylvanian leg of my journey was lost for 50 years, and only restored a few years ago by a great stroke of luck. It has been a great help to me in reconstructing that period and committing it to print, but not the unfailing prop it should have been. For in Transylvania I found myself having a much easier time of it than I had planned, drifting from one hospitable country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I came to a standstill during those long halts, writing stopped too; as I was keeping a journal of travel, I wrongly thought there was nothing to record. I was often slow to take it up again when I moved on and, even then, jotted notes sometimes took the place of sustained narrative.
Fearing some details might have got out of sequence when I started writing the present book, I surrounded these passages with a cloud of provisos and hedged bets. Then the thought that these pages were not a guidebook persuaded me that it didn’t matter very much, so I let the story tell itself free of debilitating caveats.",C2,"{'title': 'bd800f99-bf12-48f7-b66d-668dd2c95a32.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C2', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': 'Holiday reading\n\nSummer promises us two of life’s great joys: escaping home and reading books - joys that are, of course, intimately connected.

"Now stripped of its more obnoxious clauses, and above all without the insistence on a baronial committee of 25, the charter was used to recover the allegiance of those increasingly convinced that King Louis would be little better than King John. When the tide of political fortune swung decisively in the boy king’s favour, following defeats for Louis and his supporters in battle at Lincoln, Henry III once again reissued the charter, in November 1217. On this occasion, it was accompanied by a second charter covering those parts of England set aside as ‘forest’ (in theory reserved for the King’s hunting, beyond the usual rule of law). It was the contrast between the great charter of liberties and the smaller charter governing the forests that gave rise, from 1217 onwards, to the name ‘Magna Carta’ (the 'Big' or 'Great' Charter) applied to the larger of these two documents.
In 1225, at his coming of age, to buy further support and in return for taxation to defend his remaining lands in France, Henry III reissued Magna Carta. It was this charter of 1225 that henceforth became the definitive form, reissued or confirmed on numerous occasions throughout the 13th century. Like the 1216 and 1217 charters, the 1225 Magna Carta cut away nearly half of the text originally agreed at Runnymede. Out went the clauses regulating Jewish debt, taxation, the farms paid by sheriffs for their counties, the insistence that sheriffs and other officers know the laws of England, that the king expel his alien constables, that all hostages be released, and that settlements be devised with both the Welsh and the Scots. Above all, out went all mention of the baronial committee of 25 set above the king to impose justice where the king acted beyond the law.",C1,"{'title': 'text_269.txt', 'lang': 'en', 'source_name': 'elg-cefr-en', 'format': 'document-level', 'category': 'reference', 'cefr_level': 'C1', 'license': 'CC BY-NC-SA 4.0', 'text': ""Now stripped of its more obnoxious clauses, and above all without the insistence on a baronial committee of 25, the charter was used to recover the allegiance of those increasingly convinced that King Louis would be little better than King John.
